# 2.4 — Introduction to local scope

## Local variables

- Function parameters, as well as variables **defined inside the function body**, are called **local variables**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y) // function parameters x and y are local variables
  {
      int z{ x + y }; // z is a local variable too
  
      return z;
  }
  ```

## Local variable lifetime

- Local variables are **destroyed in the opposite order of creation** at the **end of the set of curly braces** in which it is defined.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y)
  {
      int z{ x + y };
  
      return z;
  } // z, y, and x destroyed here
  ```

- An object’s **lifetime** is defined to be the **time between its creation and destruction**.
- **Variable creation and destruction** happen **when the program is running** (called **runtime**), not at compile time. Therefore, lifetime is a **runtime property**.

## Local scope

- An identifier’s **scope** determines **where the identifier can be accessed** within the source code.
- When an identifier **can be accessed,** we say it is **in scope**.
- When an identifier **cannot be accessed**, we say it is **out of scope**.
- Scope is a **compile-time property**, and **trying to use an identifier when it is not in scope** will result in a **compile error**.

- A **local variable’s scope** begins at the **point of variable definition**, and stops at the **end of the set of curly braces** in which they are defined.

- Local variables **cannot be used before the point of definition**.

- A local variable’s lifetime **starts when it enters scope**, and **ends when it goes out of scope**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  // x is not in scope anywhere in this function
  void doSomething()
  {
      std::cout << "Hello!\n";
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      // x can not be used here because it's not in scope yet
  
      int x{ 0 }; // x enters scope here and can now be used
  
      doSomething();
  
      return 0;
  } // x goes out of scope here and can no longer be used
  ```

## Where to define local variables

- Local variables inside the function body should be defined **as close to their first use as reasonable**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
  	int x{}; // x defined here
  	std::cin >> x; // and used here
  
  	std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
  	int y{}; // y defined here
  	std::cin >> y; // and used here
  
  	int sum{ x + y }; // sum defined here
  	std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n'; // and used here
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```
