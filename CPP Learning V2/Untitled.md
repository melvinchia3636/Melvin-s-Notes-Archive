# Why School Sucks A Lot

Everyone wastes 12 years of his life in a miserable way in school. We have learned everything in school and have forgotten almost everything after the exams. We are taught everything without knowing how to apply this knowledge in real life. We are taught that if we do very well in the exam, get a good grade, we will get a job with an extremely high salary. We are forced to obey every single command of our teacher. In short, we are raised to be "good workers" who know how to obey.

## Exams

- Why do we have to judge a person's ability by an examination?

- We have to memorise the entire textbook or we will definitely fail the exam.
