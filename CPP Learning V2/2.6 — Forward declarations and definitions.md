# 2.6 — Forward declarations and definitions

## Forward declaration

- A **forward declaration** allows us to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier **before actually defining the identifier**.

- Forward declaration allows us to tell the compiler about **the existence of a function** before we define the function’s body.

- To write a forward declaration for a function, we use a declaration statement called a **function prototype**.

- The function prototype consists of the function’s **return type, name,  parameters**, but **no function body**, terminated with a **semicolon**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y); // function prototype includes return type, name, parameters, and semicolon.  No function body!
  ```

- Function prototypes **don't need to specify the names of the parameters**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int, int); // valid function prototype
  ```

## Other types of forward declarations

- Forward declarations can also be used with other identifiers in C++, such as **variables** and **user-defined types**.
- Variables and user-defined types have a **different syntax for forward declaration**.

## Declarations vs. definitions

### Definitions

- A definition actually **implements (for functions or types)** or **instantiates (for variables)** the identifier.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y) // implements function add()
  {
      int z{ x + y }; // instantiates variable z
  
      return z;
  }
  ```

- A definition is needed to satisfy the **linker**. If you use an identifier **without providing a definition**, **the linker will error**.

- The **one definition rule** (or ODR for short) is a well-known rule in C++.

  1. Within a given **file**, a **function, object, type, or template** can only have **one definition**.

  1. Within a given **program**, an **object or normal function** can only have **one definition**.

  1. **Types, templates, inline  functions, and variables** are allowed to have **identical definitions in  different files**.

### Declarations

- A declaration is a statement that **tells the compiler about the existence of an identifier** and its **type information**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y); // tells the compiler about a function named "add" that takes two int parameters and returns an int.  No body!
  int x; // tells the compiler about an integer variable named x
  ```

- A declaration is **all that is needed** to satisfy the compiler.

- In C++, **all definitions also serve as declarations**.

- **All declarations are NOT definitions**.

- The ODR does **NOT** apply to **pure declarations** , so you can have as **many pure declarations for an identifier** as you desire.
