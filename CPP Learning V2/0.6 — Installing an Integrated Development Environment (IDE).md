# 0.6 — Installing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- An **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) contains all of the things you need to **develop, compile, link, and debug your programs**.

- Typical C++ IDE contains a code editor that does **line numbering** and **syntax highlighting**.
- Many (but not all) IDEs include **a C++ compiler** and **a linker**, which the IDE will know how to interface with. 
- When you need to  debug your program, you can use the **integrated debugger**.

- IDE usually comes with lots of handy features, suchas **integrated help**, **name completion**, **auto-formatting**, and sometimes a **version control system**.

## Installing a compiler

- Installing **the newest version** of a compiler is recommended.

- These are the **absolute minimum compiler versions with C++17 support**:

  - GCC/G++ 7

  - clang++ 8

  - Visual Studio 2017 15.7

### Visual Studio (for Windows)

- If you are developing on a **Windows machine**, downloading [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) are recommended.

- Once you run the installer, choose **Desktop development with C++**.

- Please ensure that the **Windows 10 SDK is selected** on the rightmost panel.

- You may download [Visual Studio Express 2017 for Windows Desktop](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/express/) if **disk space and/or download size are a insufficient** (not recommended).

### Code::Blocks (for Linux or Windows)

- Code::Blocks is a **free**, **open source**, **cross-platform** IDE that will run on **both Linux and Windows**.

- If you are **developing on Linux** (or you are developing on Windows but want to write programs that you **can easily port to Linux**), [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/) is recommended. 

#### For Windows users

- Get the version of Code::Blocks that has **MinGW** bundled (it should be the one whose filename ends in `mingw-setup.exe`).
- MinGW includes a **Windows port of the GCC C++ compiler**.

#### For Linux users

- Some Linux installations may be **missing dependencies needed to run or compile programs with Code::Blocks**.

- **Debian-based Linux** users (Mint, Ubuntu etc.) may need to install the **build-essential package** with `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.

- Arch Linux users may need to install the **base-devel** package.

- Users on other Linux variants will need to determine what their equivalent **package manager and packages** are.

- If a **Compilers auto-detection** dialog shows up,  make sure **GNU GCC Compiler** is set as the default compiler.

> Q: What do I do if I get a "Can’t find compiler executable in your configured search paths for GNU GCC Compiler" error?
>
> Try the following:
>
> 1. If you’re on Windows, make sure you’ve downloaded the version of Code::Blocks WITH MinGW. It’s the one with “mingw” in the name.
> 2. Try going to settings, compiler, and choose “reset to defaults”.
> 3. Try going to settings, compiler, toolchain executables tab, and make sure  “Compiler’s installation directory” is set to the MinGW directory (e.g.  C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW).
> 4. Try doing a full uninstall, then reinstall.
> 5. [Try a different compiler.](http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Installing_a_supported_compiler)

### Mac OSX IDEs

- Popular Mac choices include [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).
- Eclipse **is not set up to use C++ by default**, and you will need to **install the optional C++ components**.

- Visual Studio for Mac **does not currently support C++**

### Other compilers or platforms

#### Q: Can I use a web-based compiler?

Web-based compilers are f**ine for dabbling and simple exercises**. However, they are generally quite limited in functionality -- many won’t allow you to  save projects, create executables, or effectively debug your programs. **You’ll want to migrate to a full IDE when you can**.

#### Q: Can I use a command-line compiler (e.g. g++ on Linux)?

Yes, but it's **not recommend it for beginners**. You’ll need to find your own editor and look up how to use it elsewhere. Using a command line debugger is not as easy as an integrated debugger, and **will make  debugging your programs more difficult**.

#### Q: Can I use other code editors or IDEs, such as Eclipse, Sublime, Notepad++, or Visual Studio Code?

Yes, but it **isn't recommend it for beginners**. There are many great code editors and IDEs that can be configured to support a wide variety of  languages, and allow you to mix and match plugins to customize your experience however you like. However, many of these editors and IDEs **require additional configuration to compile C++ programs**, and there’s a lot that can go wrong during that process.

## IDEs to avoid

- Avoid the following IDEs altogether because they **do not support at least C++11**, **do not support C++ at all**, or are **no longer actively supported or maintained**:

  - **Borland Turbo C++** - does not support C++11

  - **Visual Studio for Mac** - does not support C++

- There is no good reason to use an outdated or unsupported compiler when  lightweight, free alternatives that support modern C++ exist.
