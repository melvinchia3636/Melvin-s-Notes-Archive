# 1.7 — Keywords and naming identifiers

## Keywords

- C++ reserves a set of **92 words** (as of C++20) for its own use,  called **keywords** (or **reserved words**)
- Each keywords has **a special meaning** within the C++ language.
- IDEs will likely **change the text color** of these keywords to make them **stand out from other identifiers**.

### List of C++ keywords (through C++20):

| Row 1                   | Row 2                   | Row 3                  | Row 4         |

## Identifier naming rules

- A few rules must be followed when naming identifiers.

  - The identifier **cannot be a keyword**.

  - The identifier can only be composed of **letters** (lower or upper case),  **numbers**, and the **underscore character**. 

  - The identifier **must begin with a letteror an underscore**. It **cannot start with a number**.

  - Identifiers are **case sensitive**.

## Identifier naming best practices

- It is a convention in C++ that variable names **should begin with a lowercase letter**.

- If the variable name is **one word**, the **whole thing should be written in lowercase letters**.

  ```cpp
  int value; // correct
  
  int Value; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
  int VALUE; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
  int VaLuE; // incorrect (see your psychiatrist) ;)
  ```

- Most often, **function names are also started with a lowercase letter**.

- Identifier names that start with a **capital letter** are typically used for **user-defined types**.

- If the variable or function name is **multi-word**, there are **two common conventions**.

  - Words separated by **underscores**, called `snake_case`
  - **Intercapped** words, called `camelCase`

  ```cpp
  int my_variable_name; // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)
  int my_function_name(); // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)
  
  int myVariableName; // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)
  int myFunctionName(); // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)
  
  int my variable name; // invalid (whitespace not allowed)
  int my function name(); // invalid (whitespace not allowed)
  
  int MyVariableName; // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
  int MyFunctionName(); // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
  ```

- **Avoid** naming your identifiers **starting with an underscore**, as these names are typically **reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler** use.

- Identifiers should make clear **the meaing of the value they are holding**.

- Make the **length of an identifier** proportional to **how widely it is used**.

  | Statement          | Quality | Description                                                  |
  | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | int ccount         | Bad     | What does the c before “count” stand for?                    |
  | int customerCount  | Good    | Clear what we’re counting                                    |
  | int i              | Either  | Okay if use is trivial, bad otherwise                        |
  | int index          | Either  | Okay if obvious what we’re indexing                          |
  | int totalScore     | Either  | Okay if there’s only one thing being scored, otherwise too ambiguous |
  | int _count         | Bad     | Do not start names with underscore                           |
  | int count          | Either  | Okay if obvious what we’re counting                          |
  | int data           | Bad     | What kind of data?                                           |
  | int time           | Bad     | Is this in seconds, minutes, or hours?                       |
  | int minutesElapsed | Good    | Descriptive                                                  |
  | int value1, value2 | Either  | Can be hard to differentiate between the two                 |
  | int numApples      | Good    | Descriptive                                                  |
  | int monstersKilled | Good    | Descriptive                                                  |
  | int x, y           | Either  | Okay if use is trivial, bad otherwise                        |

- In any case, **avoid abbreviations**.

- Give your identifier a **clarifying comment**

  ```cpp
  // holds number of chars in a piece of text -- including whitespace and punctuation!
  int numberOfChars;
  ```
