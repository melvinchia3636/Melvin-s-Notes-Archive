# 1.2 — Comments

- A comment is a **programmer-readable note** that is inserted directly into the source code.
- Comments are **ignored by the compiler**.

## Single-line comments

- The `//` symbol begins a C++ **single-line comment**.

- The compiler to **ignore everything** from the `//` symbol to the end of the line.

- The single-line comment is used to make **a quick comment about a single line of code**.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to the end of the line is ignored
  ```

- If the lines are fairly short, the comments can simply **be aligned** (usually to a tab stop).

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n";                 // std::cout lives in the iostream library
  std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // this is much easier to read
  std::cout << "Yeah!\n";                        // don't you think so?
  ```

- If the lines are long, single-line comments are often placed **above the line it is commenting**.

  ```cpp
  // std::cout lives in the iostream library
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
  
  // this is much easier to read
  std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n";
  
  // don't you think so?
  std::cout << "Yeah!\n";
  ```

## Multi-line comments

- The `/*` and `*/` pair of symbols denotes a **C-style multi-line comment**. 

- Everything in between the multi-line comment symbols is **ignored**.

  ```cpp
  /* This is a multi-line comment.
     This line will be ignored.
     So will this one. */
  ```

- You will sometimes see programmers **beautify their multi-line comments**:

  ```cpp
  /* This is a multi-line comment.
   * the matching asterisks to the left
   * can make this easier to read
   */
  ```

- Multi-line style comments **cannot be nested**.

  ```cpp
  /* This is a multi-line /* comment */ this is not inside the comment */
  // The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */
  ```

## Proper use of comments

### Describe the the **usage of a library, program, or function**.

- These are typically placed **at the top of the file or library**, or **immediately preceding the function**.
- Comments tell the reader the usage of the library, program, or function **without having to look at the actual code**.
- This is particularly important **when working as part of a team**, where not everybody will be familiar with all of the code.
- Comments should be written in a way that **makes sense to newbies**.

```cpp
// This program calculates the student's final grade based on his test and homework scores.

// This function uses Newton's method to approximate the root of a given equation.

// The following lines generate a random item based on rarity, level, and a weight factor.
```

### Describe the code logic

- Give the user an idea of the code logic **without having to understand each individual line**.

```cpp
/* To calculate the final grade, we sum all the weighted midterm and homework scores
    and then divide by the number of scores to assign a percentage, which is
    used to calculate a letter grade. */

// To generate a random item, we're going to do the following:
// 1) Put all of the items of the desired rarity on a list
// 2) Calculate a probability for each item based on level and weight factor
// 3) Choose a random number
// 4) Figure out which item that random number corresponds to
// 5) Return the appropriate item
```

### Describe the reason to write a line of code.

- A **bad statement comment** explains **what the code is doing**.
- If you ever write code that is **so complex that needs a comment to explain what a statement is doing**, you **probably need to rewrite your statement**, not comment it.

#### Bad comment

We already can see that sight is being set to 0 by looking at the statement.

```cpp
// Set sight range to 0
sight = 0;
```

#### Good comment

Now we know why the player’s sight is being set to 0

```cpp
// The player just drank a potion of blindness and can not see anything
sight = 0;
```

#### Bad comment

We can see that this is a cost calculation, but why is quantity multiplied by 2?

```cpp
// Calculate the cost of the items
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```

#### Good comment:

Now we know why this formula makes sense.

```cpp
// We need to multiply quantity by 2 here because they are bought in pairs
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```

### The reason of using a particular apprroach

- Comments are a great way to remind yourself  (or tell somebody else) **the reason you made one decision** instead of another.

```cpp
// We decided to use a linked list instead of an array because
// arrays do insertion too slowly.

// We're going to use Newton's method to find the root of a number because
// there is no deterministic way to solve these equations.
```

## Commenting out code

- **Converting one or more lines of code into a comment** is called commenting out your code.
- Commenting code provides a convenient way to **(temporarily) exclude parts of your code from being compiled**.

- Use **the `//` style comment** to turn a line of code into a comment temporarily.

  ```cpp
  //    std::cout << 1;
  ```

- To comment out **a block of code**, use `//` on multiple lines of code, or the  `/* */` style comment to turn the block of code into a comment temporarily.

  ```cpp
  //    std::cout << 1;
  //    std::cout << 2;
  //    std::cout << 3;
  
  // or
  
  /*
      std::cout << 1;
      std::cout << 2;
      std::cout << 3;
  */
  ```

### Reason to comment out code

1. Commenting out **the broken code**. 
3. To **find the source of an error**.
4. Replace one piece of code **with another piece of code**.
