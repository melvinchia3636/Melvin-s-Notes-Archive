# 0.2 — Introduction to programming languages

- Computers only **natively understand a limited set of commands**
- A **computer program** (a.k.a application) is a set of instructions that the computer can execute in order to perform some task.
- The process of creating a program is called **programming**. 
- The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs is called the **hardware**.
- The process of loading a program into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction is called **running or executing the program**.

## Machine Language

- The limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly is called **machine code** (a.k.a machine language / instruction set). For example: `10110000 01100001`

- Programmers had to **write programs directly in machine language** back when computers were first invented

- Each instruction is composed of **a sequence of 1s and 0s**, called **a binary digit, or bit for short**.
  - The **number of bits that make up a single command** vary. For example, `x32` and `x86-64` CPUs have instructions have different command length.

- Each set of binary digits is **interpreted by the CPU into a command** to do a very specific job.
- Since **different CPUs have different instruction sets**, programs generally **weren’t portable** to different types of system.

## Assembly Language

- In an assembly language, each instruction is identified by **a short abbreviation[^abbreviation], and other numbers**. For example, `mov al, 061h`.

- The assembly program **must be translated into machine language** using a program called **an assembler** before it can be executed by the computer. Programs written in assembly languages tend to be very fast, and assembly is still used today when speed is critical.

  ### Downsides

  - **Understanding what an entire program is doing** can be challenging.
  - Assembly language still **isn’t very portable**

## High-level Languages

- **High level languages** such as C, C++, Pasca, Java,  Javascript, and Perl were developed to **address the readability and portability concerns**.

- Programs written in high level languages **must be translated into a format the computer can understand** before executing. 
- There are two primary ways to translate high level languages: **compiling** and **interpreting**.
- **Taditionally languages** **are compiled** like C, C++, and Pascal, whereas **scripting languages tend to be interpreted** like Perl and Javascript. Some languages, like Java, **use a mix of the two**.

### Compiler

- A compiler is a program that **reads source code** and **produces a stand-alone executable program** that can then be run.
- Once your code has been turned into an executable, you **don't need the compiler to run the program**.
- Over the years, compilers have become very good at **producing fast, optimized code**, and in some cases can do a better job than assembly language!

- Here is a simplified representation of the compiling process:

### Interpreter

- An interpreter is a program that **directly executes the instructions in the source code** without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.
-  Interpreters tend to be **more flexible than compilers**, but are **less efficient** when running programs because the interpreting process needs to be done every time the program is run. 
- This means **the interpreter is needed every time the program is run**.

- Here is a simplified representation of the interpretation process:

## Desirable Properties of High Level Languages

- High level languages are **much easier to read and write** because **the commands are closer to natural language** that we use every day.
- High level languages **require fewer instructions** to perform the same task as lower level languages, making programs **more concise[^consise] and easier to understand**.

- Programs can be **compiled (or interpreted) for many different systems / CPUs**. That means, the program is **portable**. As an example:
