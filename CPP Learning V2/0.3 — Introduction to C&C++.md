# 0.3 — Introduction to C / C++

## C

- C was developed **in 1972** by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Telephone laboratories**,

- C act primarily as a **systems programming language**. 


### Desirable Properties

- Easy to compile
- Allow efficient access to memory
- Produce efficient code
- Self-contained.
- Flexible while being portable

### C and the Unix

- In 1973, **Ritchie** and **Ken Thompson** rewrote most of the Unix operating system that had been written in assembly **using C**.
  - C has **excellent portability**, allowing Unix to be **easily recompiled on many different types of computers**.
  - C’s popularity was in part tied to **the success of Unix as an operating system**.

### The Road to Standardisation

- In 1978, **Brian Kernighan** and **Dennis Ritchie** published a book called “**The C Programming Language**”.
  - This book was commonly known as **K&R** (after the authors’ last names)
  - The book contains an **informal specification for the language** and **became a de facto standard**. Most compilers at the time were implemented to **K&R standards** since it provided **maximum portability**.

- In 1983, the **American National Standards Institute** (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a **formal standard for C**.

  - In 1989, the **C89 standard** as finished and released, also known as **ANSI C**.
  - In 1990 the **International Organization for Standardization** (ISO) adopted ANSI C with a few minor modifications, a.k.a **C90**.
  - Compilers eventually became **ANSI C/C90 compliant**, and programs desiring **maximum portability** were coded to this standard.

  - In 1999, the ANSI committee released **a new version of C called C99**.
    - C99 adopted many features which had already **become part of compiler extensions**, or **had been implemented in C++**.

## C++

- C++ was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** at **Bell Labs** as **an extension to C,** starting **in 1979**. 

- C++ adds **many new features** to the C language.
- C++’s claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an **object-oriented language**. 

- C++ **was standardized in 1998** by the **ISO committee**.

- A **minor update** to the language was released in 2003 (called **C++03**).

- Four **major updates** to the C++ language (**C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20**) added **additional functionality** to the language.
- **C++11** added **a huge number of new capabilities**, and is widely considered to be **the new baseline version of the language**. 
- Future upgrades to the language are expected **every three or so years**, with the feature set for **C++23** already starting to be formulated.

- Each new formal release of the language is called a **language standard** (or **language specification**), which are **named after the year they are released in**.

> ##### 💡C and C++’s Philosophy
>
> C++ is designed to allow the programmer **a high degree of freedom** to do what they want, and it often won’t stop you from doing things that don’t make sense. There are quite a few pitfalls that new programmers are likely to fall into. Hence, knowing what you shouldn’t do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.
