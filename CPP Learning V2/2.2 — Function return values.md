# 2.2 ‚Äî Function return values

## Return values

- When you write a user-defined function, you get to determine whether your function will **return a value back to the caller or not**.

- Your function has to indicate what **type of value will be returned** ** by setting the function‚Äôs r**eturn type**, which is the type that is defined **before the function‚Äôs name**.

- Second, **inside the function** that will return a value, we use a **return statement** to indicate the specific value being returned to the caller, called **the return value**.

- The process of **copying the return value from the function back to the caller** when the return statement is executed is called **return by value**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  // int is the return type
  // A return type of int means the function will return some integer value to the caller (the specific value is not specified here)
  int returnFive()
  {
      // the return statement indicates the specific value that will be returned
      return 5; // return the specific value 5 back to the caller
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << returnFive() << '\n'; // prints 5
      std::cout << returnFive() + 2 << '\n'; // prints 7
  
      returnFive(); // okay: the value 5 is returned, but is ignored since main() doesn't do anything with it
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  When run, this program prints:

  ```
  5
  7
  ```

  

- When a called function returns a value, the caller may **use that value** or **ignore it**.

- If a function has a **non-void return type**, it **must return a value of that type** using a return statement.

- When a **return statement is executed**, any additional code **below the return statement** is **ignored**.

- A function can only return **a single value** back to the caller each time it is called.

- it‚Äôs a good idea to **document your function** with a comment indicating **what the return values mean**.

## Void return values

- Functions are **not required** to return a value.

- To tell the compiler that a function **does not return a value**, a return type of **void** is used.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  // void means the function does not return a value to the caller
  void returnNothing()
  {
      std::cout << "Hi" << '\n';
      // This function does not return a value so no return statement is needed
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      returnNothing(); // okay: function returnNothing() is called, no value is returned
  
      std::cout << returnNothing(); // error: this line will not compile.  You'll need to comment it out to continue.
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

## Returning to main

- ` main` function returns **an integer value (usually 0)**, and **your program terminates**.
- The return value from `main` is sometimes called a **status code** (also sometimes called an **exit code**, or rarely a **return code**), as it is used to indicate **whether the program ran successfully or not**.

- By definition, **a status code of 0** means the program **executed successfully.**

- A **non-zero status code** is often used to indicate **failure**.
- C++ **disallows** calling the `main` function **explicitly**.

>üí° **For advanced readers**
>
>- The C++ standard only defines the meaning of 3 status codes: **0**,  **EXIT_SUCCESS**, and **EXIT_FAILURE**.
>- 0 and EXIT_SUCCESS both mean the program **executed successfully**.
>- EXIT_FAILURE means the program **did not execute successfully.**
>
>- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are defined in the **<cstdlib>** header
>
>  ```cpp
>  #include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE
>  
>  int main()
>  {
>      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
>  }
>  ```
>
>- If you want to **maximize portability**, you should only use **0 or EXIT_SUCCESS** to indicate a **successful termination**, or **EXIT_FAILURE** to indicate an **unsuccessful termination**.

## Reusing functions

- This is the essence of modular programming: the ability to **write a function**, **test it**, **ensure that it works**, and then know that we can **reuse it as many times as we want** and it will continue to work.
- Follow the **DRY** best practice: ‚Äú**don‚Äôt repeat yourself**‚Äù. 

## Conclusion

- **Return values** provide a way for functions to **return a single value back to the function‚Äôs caller**.

- Functions provide a way to **minimize redundancy** in our programs.
