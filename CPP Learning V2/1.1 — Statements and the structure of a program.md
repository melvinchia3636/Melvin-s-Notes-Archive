# 1.1 ‚Äî Statements and the structure of a program

## Statements

- A **computer program** is **a sequence of instructions** that tell the computer what to do.

- A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to **perform some action**.

- A statement is **the smallest independent unit of computation** in the C++ language.

- Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a **semicolon**.

- A single statement may compile into **many machine language instructions**.

> üí°**For advanced readers**
>
> There are many different kinds of statements in C++:
>
> 1. Declaration statements (`int x = 0`)
> 2. Jump statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`)
> 3. Expression statements (`1+1`, `func()`)
> 4. Compound statements (`int main() {}`)
> 5. Selection statements (conditionals) (`if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch`)
> 6. Iteration statements (loops) (`for`, `while`)
> 7. Try blocks (`try`, `catch`)

## Functions and the main function

- In C++, statements are typically grouped into units called **functions**.
- A function is **a collection of statements that executes sequentially**.

### Rule

- Every C++ program **must have** a special function named `main` (all lower case letters).
- The statements inside of `main` are **executed first** when the program starts..

- Programs typically **terminate** when the last statement inside function `main` has executed.

- Functions are typically written to do **a specific job**.

## Dissecting Hello world!

Below are a typical Hello World function written in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```

| Line Number | Type                   | Descriptions                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1           | Preprocessor Directive | Indicates that we would like to use the contents of the **iostream library**, allowing us to **read from and write to the console**. |
| 2           | Blank                  | Will be **ignored** by the compilter.                        |
| 3           | Function Defining      | Tells the compiler that we‚Äôre going to **define a function** called `main` |
| 4           | Statement Expression   | Creates a visible output of the program **to the console**.<br />`std::cout` (which stands for ‚Äú**character output**‚Äù) and the `<<` operator allow us to **output letters or numbers to the console**. |
| 5           | Return Statement       | **Send a value to the OS** after program finish running. Value `0` means ‚Äú**everything went okay!**‚Äù. |

### Output

The output of the Hello World program above will be:

```
Hello world!
```

## Syntax and syntax errors

- Syntax in C++ rules about **how your programs must be constructed** in order to be considered valid. 
- The compiler is responsible for making sure your program follows the **basic syntax of the C++ language**.
- If you violate a rule, the compilter will issue you a **syntax error**.
- Compilation of a program will only complete **once all syntax errors are resolved**.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!"
   return 0;
}

```

The following error emerged (there might be some slight difference in different compiler):

```
c:\vcprojects\test1.cpp(6): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'
```

This is telling you that you have a syntax error on **line 6**: the compiler was expecting a **semicolon before the return statement**, but it didn‚Äôt find one.
