# 1.8 — Whitespace and basic formatting

- **Whitespace** is a term that refers to **characters that are used for formatting purposes**.

- In C++, whitespace refers primarily to **spaces, tabs, and newlines**. 

- The C++ compiler generally **ignores whitespace**, with a few minor exceptions when **processing text literals**.

- We say that C++ is a **whitespace-independent language**.

  ```cpp
  // all of these produce the same thing
  
  std::cout << "Hello world!";
  
  std::cout               <<            "Hello world!";
  
  		std::cout << 		"Hello world!";
  
  std::cout
  	<< "Hello world!";The following functions all do the same thing:
  ```

  ```cpp
  // all of these produce the same thing
  
  int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }
  
  int add(int x, int y) {
      return x + y; }
  
  int add(int x, int y)
  {    return x + y; }
  
  int add(int x, int y)
  {
      return x + y;
  }
  ```

- C++ compiler does pay attention to whitespace is **inside quoted text**, such as `"Hello world!"`.

  ```cpp
  "Hello world!"
  ```

  is different than:

  ```cpp
  "Hello     world!"
  ```

- **Newlines are not allowed** in quoted text.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello
       world!"; // Not allowed!
  ```

- Quoted text separated by nothing but whitespace **will be concatenated**.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello "
       "world!"; // prints "Hello world!"
  ```

- C++ compiler pays attention to whitespace is with **singleline comments**.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello world!"; // Here is a single-line comment
  this is not part of the comment
  ```

## Basic formatting

- C++ **does not enforce code formatting**.
- Best styles are the ones that **produce the most readable code**, and **provide the most consistency**.

### Basic formatting recommendations

1. It’s fine to use **either tabs or spaces for indentation**.

2. There are **two** acceptable styles for **function braces**.

   - Putting the opening curly brace **on the same line as the statement**.

     ```cpp
     int main() {
     }
     ```

     - It **reduces the amount of vertical whitespace**, so you can **fit more code on a screen**. More code on a screen makes the program **easier to understand**.

   - Opening brace appears on **its own line**.

     ```cpp
     // very wierd
     int main()
     {
     }
     ```

     - This **enhances readability**, and is **less error prone** since your brace pairs **should always be indented at the same level**.

3. Each statement within curly braces should **start one tab in from the opening brace** of the function it belongs to.

   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
       std::cout << "Nice to meet you.\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
   }
   ```

4. Lines **should not be too long**.

- Typically, **80 characters** is the **maximum length** a line should be.

- If a line is going to be longer, it **should be split** (at a reasonable spot) into **multiple lines**. 

- Indent each subsequent line with **an extra tab**, or if the lines are similar, by **aligning it with the line above** (whichever is easier to read).

```cpp 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "This is a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, "
        "really long line\n"; // one extra indentation for continuation line

    std::cout << "This is another really, really, really, really, really, really, really, "
                 "really long line\n"; // text aligned with the previous line for continuation line

    std::cout << "This one is short\n";
}
```

5. If **a long line is split with an operator** (eg. << or +), the operator should be placed **at the beginning of the next line**, not the end of the current line.

   - This make it clearer that subsequent lines are **continuations of the previous lines**.
   - This allows you to **align the operators on the left**, which makes for **easier reading**.

   ```cpp
   std::cout << 3 + 4
       + 5 + 6
       * 7 * 8;
   ```

6. Use **whitespace** to make your code easier to read by **aligning values or comments** or **adding spacing between blocks of code**.

   ```cpp
   cost          = 57;
   pricePerItem  = 24;
   value         = 5;
   numberOfItems = 17;
   ```

   ```cpp
   std::cout << "Hello world!\n";                  // cout lives in the iostream library
   std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n";  // these comments are easier to read
   std::cout << "Yeah!\n";                         // especially when all lined up
   
   // OR
   
   // cout lives in the iostream library
   std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
   
   // these comments are easier to read
   std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n";
   
   // when separated by whitespace
   std::cout << "Yeah!\n";
   ```
