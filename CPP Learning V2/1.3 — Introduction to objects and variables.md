# 1.3 — Introduction to objects and variables

## Data

- Programs produce results by **manipulating (reading, changing, and writing) data**.
- In computing, **data** is **any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer**.

- A program can acquire data to work with in many ways.
  - from a **file or database**
  - over a **network**
  - from the user providing **input on a keyboard**
  - from the programmer putting data **directly into the source code of the program** itself

- Data on a computer is typically stored in a format that is **efficient for storage or processing** (and is thus **not human readable**).

## Objects and variables

- Computers have **RAM** (short for **random access memory**) that is available for programs to use.

- In C++, **direct memory access is not allowed** and we access memory indirectly through an **object**.
- An object is **a region of storage** (usually memory) that **has a value and other associated properties**. 
- We can say, **go get the value stored by this object**, means we **don't have to worry about where in memory they’re actually being placed**.

- Objects can be **named or unnamed** (anonymous).
- A named object is called a **variable**, and the name of the object is called an **identifier**.

## Variable instantiation

- In order to create a variable, we use a **definition statement**.

  ```cpp
  int x; // define a variable named x, of type int
  ```

- At compile time, the compiler **define a variable**, giving it the name `x`, and that it is of type `int`.
- From that point forward, whenever the compiler sees the identifier `x`, it will know that we’re **referencing this variable**.

- The variable **will be instantiated** when the program is run (called **runtime**), 
- Instantiation means the object **will be created and assigned a memory address**.
- Variables **must be instantiated before they can be used** to store values. 

## Data types

- A data type (more commonly just called a type) tells the compiler **what type of value the variable will store** (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etc…).

- An **integer** is a number that **can be written without a fractional component**. For short, we can say that *x* is an **integer variable**.

- In C++, the type of a variable **must be known at compile-time** and it is **unchangable**.

- Another example of defining a variable using data type `double`

  ```cpp
  double width; // define a variable named width, of type double
  ```

## Defining multiple variables

- You can **define multiple variables of the same type in a single statement** by separating the names with a **comma**.

  ```cpp
  int a;
  int b;
  
  // is the same as
  
  int a, b;
  ```

- You can't give each variable a type **when defining variables in sequence**.

  ```cpp
  int a, int b; // wrong (compiler error)
  
  int a, b; // correct
  ```

- Variables of **different types** must  be defined in **separate statements**.

  ```cpp
  int a, double b; // wrong (compiler error)
  
  int a; double b; // correct (but not recommended)
  
  // correct and recommended (easier to read)
  int a;
  double b;
  ```
