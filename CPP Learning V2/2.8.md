# 2.8 — Naming collisions and an introduction to namespaces

- C++ requires that **all identifiers be non-ambiguous**.
- If **two identical identifiers are introduced into the same program** in a way that the compiler or linker can’t tell them apart, the compiler or linker will **produce an error** called **naming collision** (or **naming conflict**).

- Most naming collisions occur in **two cases**.

  1. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into **separate files** that are compiled into the **same program**.  This will result in a **linker error**.

  1. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into **the same file** (often via an **#include**). This will result in a **compiler error**.

- C++ provides plenty of mechanisms for **avoiding naming collisions**.

## What is a namespace?

- A **namespace** is a region that allows you to **declare names inside of it** for the purpose of **disambiguation**.
- The namespace provides a **scope region** (called **namespace scope**) to the names declared inside of it.
- Any name declared inside the namespace **won’t be mistaken for identical names in other scopes**.

- **Within a namespace**, all names must be **unique**, otherwise a **naming collision** will result.

- Namespaces are often used to **group related identifiers in a large project** to help ensure they **don’t inadvertently collide** with other identifiers.

## The global namespace

- In C++, any name that is **not defined inside a class, function, or a namespace** is considered to be part of an **implicitly defined namespace** called the **global namespace**, aka **global scope**.

- Only **declarations and definition statements** can appear in the global namespace.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream> // handled by preprocessor
  
  // All of the following statements are part of the global namespace
  void foo();    // okay: function forward declaration in the global namespace
  int x;         // compiles but strongly discouraged: uninitialized variable definition in the global namespace
  int y { 5 };   // compiles but discouraged: variable definition with initializer in the global namespace
  x = 5;         // compile error: executable statements not allowed in the global namespace
  
  int main()     // okay: function definition in the global namespace
  {
      return 0;
  }
  
  void goo();    // okay: another function forward declaration in the global namespace
  ```

## The std namespace

- When C++ was **originally designed**, all of the identifiers in the **C++ standard library** were available to be used **without the *std::* prefix** (they were **part of the global namespace**).

- Later, C++ moved all of the functionality in the standard library into a **namespace named “std”**  (short for **standard**).

- When you use an identifier that is defined inside a namespace (such as the *std* namespace), you have to tell the compiler that **the identifier lives inside the namespace**.

  - Explicit **namespace qualifier** std

    - The **:: symbol** is an operator called the **scope resolution operator**.
    - The identifier to the left of the :: symbol identifies the **namespace** that the name to the right of the :: symbol **is contained within**. If **no identifier to the left** of the :: symbol is provided, the **global namespace is assumed**.

    - So when we say `std::cout`, we’re saying “**the `cout` that lives in namespace `std`**”.

    - This is the **safest way** to use identifiers, because there’s **no ambiguity** about which identifier we’re referencing.

  - **Using namespace std** (and why to **avoid** it)

    - Another way to access identifiers inside a namespace is to use a **using directive** statement. 

      ```cpp
      #include <iostream>
      
      using namespace std; // this is a using directive telling the compiler to check the std namespace when resolving identifiers with no prefix
      
      int main()
      {
          cout << "Hello world!"; // cout has no prefix, so the compiler will check to see if cout is defined locally or in namespace std
          return 0;
      }
      ```

    - A using directive tells the compiler to **check a specified namespace** when trying to resolve an identifier that has **no namespace prefix**.

    - Many texts, tutorials, and even some compilers **recommend or use a using-directive at the top of the program**. However, used in this way,  this is a **bad practice**, and **highly discouraged**.
    - **Avoid using-directives** (such as *using namespace std;*) at the top of your program or in header files. They **violate the reason why namespaces were added** in the first place.
