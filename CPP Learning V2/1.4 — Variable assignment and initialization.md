# 1.4 — Variable assignment and initialization

## Variable assignment

- After a variable has been defined, you can **give it a value** (in a separate statement) using the `=` operator. This process is called **copy assignment** (or just assignment).

  ```cpp
  int width; // define an integer variable named width
  width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width
  
  // variable width now has value 5
  ```

- The `=` operator is called the **assignment operator**.
-  Normal variables can only **hold one value at a time**.

- You can use assignment **as many time as you want**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  	int width;
  	width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width
  
  	// variable width now has value 5
  
  	width = 7; // change value stored in variable width to 7
  
  	// variable width now has value 7
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```

>⚠️ **Warning**

>- **Assignment** (`=`) is used to **assign a value to a variable**.
>- **Equality** (`==`) is used to **test whether two operands are equal in value**.

## Initialization

- Variable **asignment and definition can be combined**.
- You can do **variable initialization** by **provide an initial value for the variable** when a variable is defined.
- **The value used to initialize a variable** is called an **initializer**.

### Basic ways to initialize variables in C++

```cpp
int a; // no initializer
int b = 5; // initializer after equals sign
int c( 6 ); // initializer in parenthesis
int d { 7 }; // initializer in braces
```

#### Default initialization

- When **no initialization value is provided**, this is called **default initialization**.

- In most cases, default initialization leaves a variable with **an indeterminate value**.

#### Copy initialization

- When **an initializer is provided after an equals sign**, this is called **copy initialization**.

- Copy initialization was inherited from the **C language**.

  ```cpp
  int width = 5; // copy initialization of value 5 into variable width
  ```

#### Direct initialization

- When **an initializer is provided inside parenthesis**, this is called **direct initialization**.

  ```cpp
  int width( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
  ```

#### Brace initialization

- To provide a **more consistent initialization mechanism**, there’s **brace initialization** (also called **uniform initialization** or **list initialization**) that uses **curly braces**.

- Brace initialization comes in **three forms**.

  ```cpp
  int width { 5 }; // direct brace initialization of value 5 into variable width (preferred)
  int height = { 6 }; // copy brace initialization of value 6 into variable height
  int depth {}; // value initialization (see next section)
  ```

- If you try to use brace initialization to **initialize a variable with a value it can not safely hold**, the compiler will **throw a warning or an error**.

  ```cpp
  int width { 4.5 }; // error: not all double values fit into an int
  ```

- Conversions that can be done **without potential data loss** are allowed.

## Value initialization and zero initialization

- When a variable is **initialized with empty braces**, value initialization takes place.

- Value initialization will initialize the variable to **zero** (or **empty**), called **zero initialization**.

  ```cpp
  int width {}; // zero initialization to value 0
  ```

- Use an **explicit initialization** value if you’re **actually using that value**.

  ```cpp
  int x { 0 }; // explicit initialization to value 0
  std::cout << x; // we're using that zero value
  ```

- Use **value initialization** if the value is **temporary and will be replaced**.

  ```cpp
  int x {}; // value initialization
  std::cin >> x; // we're immediately replacing that value
  ```

- **Bjarne Stroustrup** (creator of C++) and **Herb Sutter** (C++  expert) make this recommendation themselves [here](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es20-always-initialize-an-object).

## Initializing multiple variables

- You can initialize **multiple variables defined on the same line**:

  ```cpp
  int a = 5, b = 6; // copy initialization
  int c( 7 ), d( 8 ); // direct initialization
  int e { 9 }, f { 10 }; // brace initialization (preferred)
  ```

- Don't try to **initialize both variables** by using **one initialization statement**:

  ```cpp
  int a, b = 5; // wrong (a is not initialized!)
  
  int a = 5, b = 5; // correct
  ```
