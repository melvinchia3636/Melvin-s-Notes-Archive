# 2.5 — Why functions are useful, and how to use them effectively

## Why use functions?

### Organization 

- A function can be written **separately from the main program**.
- This allows us to reduce a complicated program into **smaller, more manageable chunks**, which **reduces the overall complexity** of our program.

### Reusability 

- Once a function is written, it can be **called multiple times** from within the program.
- Function **avoids duplicated code** and minimizes the probability of **copy/paste errors**.
- Functions can also be **shared with other programs**, reducing the amount of code that has to be **written from scratch** (and retested) each time.

### Testing 

- Because functions reduce code redundancy, there’s **less code to test** in the first place.
- Cecause functions are **self-contained**, once we’ve tested a function to ensure it works, we **don’t need to test it again unless we change it**.
- Functions make it **much easier to find bugs** (or **avoid them** in the first place).

### Extensibility 

- Functions allow us to **make the change in one place** and have that change t**ake effect every time the function is called**.

### Abstraction

- In order to use a function, you only need to know its **name, inputs, outputs, and where it lives**.
- This **lowers the amount of knowledge** required to **use other people’s code**.

## Effectively using functions

- Groups of statements that **appear more than once** in a program should generally be **made into a function**.
- Code that has a **well-defined set of inputs and outputs** is a good candidate for a function, (particularly if it is complicated).
- A function should generally perform **one (and only one) task**.
- When a function becomes too long, too complicated, or hard to understand, it can be **split into multiple sub-functions**. This process is called **refactoring**.
