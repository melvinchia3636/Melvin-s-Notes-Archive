# 1.6 — Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior

## Uninitialized variables

- C/C++ **does not** initialize most variables to a given value **automatically**.
- The **default value** of that variable is whatever (**garbage**) value happens to **already be in that memory location** that is assigned to the variable.
- A variable that **has not been given a known value** is called an **uninitialized variable**.

- Using the values of uninitialized variables can lead to **unexpected results**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      // define an integer variable named x
      int x; // this variable is uninitialized because we haven't given it a value
  
      // print the value of x to the screen
      std::cout << x; // who knows what we'll get, because x is uninitialized
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- Most modern compilers will attempt to **detect if a variable is being used without being given a value**.

- Compiler will  generally **issue a compile-time error.** for **using an uninitialized value**

  ```
  c:\VCprojects\test\test.cpp(11) : warning C4700: uninitialized local variable 'x' used
  ```

## Undefined behavior

- Using the value from an uninitialized variable will result in **undefined behavior**.
- **Undefined behavior** (often abbreviated UB) is the result of executing code whose behavior is **not well defined by the C++ language**.
- The C++ language **doesn’t have any rules** determining what happens if you use the value of a variable that **has not been given a known value**. 

- Code implementing **undefined behavior** may exhibit **any** of the following symptoms:

  - Produces **different results** every time it is run.

  - Consistently produces the **same incorrect result**.

  - Behaves **inconsistently** (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).

  - Seems like its working but **produces incorrect results later** in the program.

  - **Crashes**, either immediately or later.

  - Works on **some** compilers but not others.

  - Works **until you change some other seemingly unrelated code**.
