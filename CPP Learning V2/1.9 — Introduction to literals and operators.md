# 1.9 — Introduction to literals and operators

## Literals

- A **literal** (also known as a **literal constant**) is a **fixed value** that has been **inserted directly into the source code**.

- The value of a literal is **fixed** and **can’t be changed** (hence it being called a **constant**)

## Operators

- An **operation** is a **mathematical calculation** involving **zero or more input values** (called **operands**) that produces a **new value** (called an **output value**).
- Operation is denoted by a construct called an **operator.**

- The **number of operands** that an operator takes as input is called the **operator’s arity**.

- Operators in C++ come in **three different arities**.

  - **Unary** operators act on **one operand**.

  - **Binary** operators act on **two operands** (known as **left** and **right**). 

  - **Ternary** operators act on **three operands**.

- Some operators have **more than one meaning** depending on how they are used.

## Chaining operators

- Operators can be **chained together** such that the **output of one operator** can be used as **the input for another operator**. 

- The arithmetic operators execute **in the same order as they do in standard mathematics**. 
  - The order is **Parenthesis** first, then **Exponents**, then **Multiplication & Division**, then **Addition & Subtraction**. 
  - This ordering is sometimes abbreviated **PEMDAS**, or expanded to the mnemonic “**Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally**”.
