# 2.1 — Introduction to functions

- A **function** is a **reusable sequence of statements** designed to **do a particular job**.

- Functions provide a way for us to **split our programs into small, modular chunks** that are **easier to organize, test, and use**.
- The **C++ standard library** comes with plenty of **already-written functions** for you to use
- Functions that you **write yourself** are called **user-defined functions**.

- A program will be **executing statements sequentially** inside one function when it encounters a **function call**.
- A **function call** is an expression that tells the CPU to **interrupt the current function and execute another function**.

- The function **initiating the function call** is called the **caller**, and the **function being called** is the callee or **called function**.

## User-defined function

- Below is the **most basic syntax** to define a user-defined function.

  ```
  return-type identifier() // identifier replaced with the name of your function
  {
  // Your code here
  }
  ```

- Here is a **sample program** that shows **how a new function is defined and called**:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream> // for std::cout
  
  // Definition of user-defined function doPrint()
  void doPrint() // doPrint() is the called function in this example
  {
      std::cout << "In doPrint()\n";
  }
  
  // Definition of function main()
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
      doPrint(); // Interrupt main() by making a function call to doPrint().  main() is the caller.
      std::cout << "Ending main()\n"; // this statement is executed after doPrint() ends
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  This program produces the following output:

  ```
  Starting main()
  In doPrint()
  Ending main()Calling functions more than once
  ```

- Function can be **called more than once**

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream> // for std::cout
  
  void doPrint()
  {
      std::cout << "In doPrint()\n";
  }
  
  // Definition of function main()
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
      doPrint(); // doPrint() called for the first time
      doPrint(); // doPrint() called for the second time
      std::cout << "Ending main()\n";
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  This program produces the following output:

  ```
  Starting main()
  In doPrint()
  In doPrint()
  Ending main()
  ```

## Functions calling functions calling functions

- Any function **can call any other function**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream> // for std::cout
  
  void doB()
  {
      std::cout << "In doB()\n";
  }
  
  
  void doA()
  {
      std::cout << "Starting doA()\n";
  
      doB();
  
      std::cout << "Ending doA()\n";
  }
  
  // Definition of function main()
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
  
      doA();
  
      std::cout << "Ending main()\n";
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  This program produces the following output

  ```cpp
  Starting main()
  Starting doA()
  In doB()
  Ending doA()
  Ending main()
  ```

## Nested functions are not supported

- In C++, functions **cannot be defined inside other functions**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      void foo() // Illegal: this function is nested inside function main()
      {
          std::cout << "foo!\n";
      }
  
      foo(); // function call to foo()
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  The proper way to write the above program is

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  void foo() // no longer inside of main()
  {
      std::cout << "foo!\n";
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      foo();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

> - Such words are called [metasyntactic variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) (though in common language they’re often called “**placeholder names**”).
> - Other common metasyntactic variables in C++ include “bar”, “baz”, and **3-letter words that end in “oo”**, such as “goo”, “moo”, and “boo”).
