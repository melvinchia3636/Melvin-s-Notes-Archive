# 1.5 — Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

## The input / output library

- The **input/output library** (io library) is part of the **C++ standard library** that deals with **basic input and output**. 
- We’ll use the functionality in this library to **get input from the keyboard** and **output data to the console**.
- The **io** part of `iostream` stands for **input/output**.

- Include the `iostream` **header at the top of any code file** that uses the content defined in` iostream`.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  // rest of code that uses iostream functionality here
  ```

## std::cout

- `std::cout` allows us to **send data to the console to be printed as text**. `cout` stands for "**character output**".

- We use `std::cout` along with the **insertion operator** (`<<`).

- `std::cout` can not only print text, it can also **print numbers**:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream> // for std::cout
  
  int main()
  {
    	std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl; // print "Hello world!" to the console
      std::cout << 4; // print 4 to console
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  This produces the result:

  ```
  Hello World!
  4
  ```

- It can also be used to **print the value of variables**.

  ```cpp
  int x{ 5 }; // define integer variable x, initialized with value 5
  std::cout << x; // print value of x (5) to console
  return 0;This produces the result:
  ```

  This will result in:

  ```
  5
  ```

- The **insertion operator** (`<<`) can be used **multiple times** in a single statement to **concatenate multiple pieces of output**.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
  ```

  This statement prints:

  ```
  Hello world!
  ```

- You can print **both text and the value of a variable** in the same statement:

  ```cpp
  int x{ 5 };
  std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x;
  ```

  This statement results:

  ```
  x is equal to: 5
  ```

## std::endl

- `std::endl` prints **a newline character** to the console.

- In this context, `endl` stands for “**end line**”.

  ```cpp
  // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line of the console
  std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; 
  std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;
  ```

  This prints:

  ```
  Hi!
  My name is Alex.
  ```

## std::endl vs ‘\n’

- Using **std::endl** can be a bit **inefficient** since it **flushes the output**.
- When writing text to the console using std::cout, **std::cout also often flushes output**.

- Use of the `\n`  character is **typically preferred instead**.

- The `\n` character moves the  cursor to the next line **without requesting a flush**

- The `\n`  character also tends to be **easier to read** since it’s **shorter** and **can be embedded into existing text**.

  ```cpp
  int x{ 5 };
  std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // Using '\n' standalone
  std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n"; // Using '\n' embedded into a double-quoted piece of text (note: no single quotes when used this way)
  ```

  This prints:

  ```
  x is equal to: 5
  And that's all, folks!
  ```

- When `\n` is used by itself, **the single quotes are needed**.
- When **embedded into text** that is already double-quoted, **the single quotes aren’t needed**.
- `\n` uses a **backslash** (as do all special characters in C++), **not a forward slash**. 

## std::cin

- `std::cin` (which stands for “**character input**”) **reads input from keyboard** using the **extraction operator** (`>>`).

-  The input **must be stored in a variable** to be used.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number
  
  int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
  std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x
  
  std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';
  ```

- You don’t need to use `\n` when accepting input, as the user will need to press the `enter` key to have their input accepted, and this will **move the cursor to the next line**.

- It is also possible to **input more than one value on a single line**:

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers separated by a space: ";
  
  int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
  int y{ }; // define variable y to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
  std::cin >> x >> y; // get two numbers and store in variable x and y respectively
  
  std::cout << "You entered " << x << " and " << y << '\n';
  ```

  This produces the output:

  ```
  Enter two numbers separated by a space: 5 6
  You entered 5 and 6
  ```

>💡 **For advanced readers**
>
>The C++ I/O library **does not provide a way to accept keyboard input without press enter**. If this is something you desire, you’ll have to use **a third party library**. For console applications, we’d recommend the [pdcurses](https://pdcurses.org/) library. Many graphical user libraries have their own functions to do this kind of thing.

## Summary

- `std::cin` and `std::cout` always go on the **left-hand side of the statement**
- `std::cout` is used to **output a value** (cout = **character output**)
- `std::cin` is used to get an **input value** (cin = **character input**)
- `<<` is used with `std::cout`
- `>>` is used with `std::cin`
