# 0.4 — Introduction to C++ development, compiler, linker, and libraries

- Here is a graphic outlining a simplistic approach of how C++ programs get developed:

## Step 1: Define problem to solve

- Figure out **what problem you are intending to solve**.

- Coming up with **the initial idea for what you would like to program** can be the easiest step, or the hardest.

Here are a few examples:

- “I want to write a program that will allow me to **enter many numbers, then calculates the average.**”
- “I want to write a program that **generates a 2d maze** and **lets the user navigate through it**. The user wins if **they reach the end**.”
- “I want to write a program that **reads in a file of stock prices** and **predicts whether the stock will go up or down**.”

## Step 2: Design a solution

- Determine **how you are going to solve the problem** you came up with.
- There are **many ways to solve a problem**, some of them good and some of them are bad.
- Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:

  - They are **straightforward** (not overly complicated or confusing).
  - They are **well documented** (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
  - They are **built modularly**, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
  - They are **robust**, and **can recover or give useful error messages** when something unexpected happens.

> 🐞**Bug**
>
> The term *bug* was first used by **Thomas Edison** back in the **1870s** and popularized in the **1940s** when engineers found an **actual moth** stuck in the hardware of an early computer, **causing a short circuit**. Both the log book in which the error was reported and the moth are now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. It can be viewed [here](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334663).

## Step 3: Write the program

- First, learn a **programming language**.
- Second, get yourself a **text editor** to write and save written programs. 
- The programs we write using C++ instructions are called **source code** (a.k.a **code**). 
- Please use an editor that is designed for programming  (called a **code editor**), never consider using Windows builtin Notepad.
- The programs you write will typically be named `something.cpp` or `something.cc`. The .cpp extension tells the compiler (and you) that this is a **C++ source code file**.

#### Features of a Code Editor

1. **Line numbering**. Line numbering is useful **when the compiler gives us an error,** for example: `some error code/message, line 64`.
2. **Syntax highlighting**. Syntax highlighting changes the colors of your code to make it easier to identify the different components of your program. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Colored text!";
    return 0;
}
```

3. An unambiguous[^unambiguous] font. A good programming font will ensure **every symbol are visually differentiated** in order to ensure one isn’t accidentally used in place of the other. 

## Step 4: Compiling your source code

- We use a **C++ compiler** In order to compile a C++ program. 

- The C++ compiler **sequentially goes through each CPP file** in your program and does two important tasks:

  - Checks if your code **follows the rules of the C++ language**. If not, **an error message will show up** and the compilation process **will be aborted until the error is fixed**.

  - Translates your C++ source code into **a machine language file** called an **object file**. Object files are typically named `name.o` or `name.obj`

- If your program had **3 .cpp files**, the compiler would generate **3 object files**:

## Step 5: Linking object files and libraries

- After the compilation is done, then another program called the **linker** kicks in. The job of the linker is:

  1. Take all the object files and combine them into **a single executable program**.

  ![The linking process](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/LinkingObjects-min.png?ezimgfmt=rs:441x271/rscb2/ng:webp/ngcb2)

  2. The linker also is capable of linking **library files**, a collection of **precompiled code** that has been packaged for **reuse**.

     - The C++ core language is fairly small and concise, but comes with an extensive library called the **C++ Standard Library** (a.k.a **standard library**) that provides additional functionalities.

     - One of the most commonly used parts of the C++ standard library is the **iostream** library, which can **output text** and **get input** from a user.

     -  Almost every C++ program written **utilizes the standard library in some form**, so it’s very common for the standard library to get linked into your programs.

     - You can also optionally link in **other libraries**.

  3. Make sure **all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly**. For example, if you define something in one .cpp file, and then use it in another .cpp  file, the linker connects the two together.

- You will have **an executable file that you can then run** once the linker is finished linking all the object files and libraries without issue.

> 💡**For advanced readers**
>
> For complex projects, some development environments use a **makefile**, which is a file that **describes how to build a program** (e.g. which files to compile and link, or otherwise process in various ways). Entire books have been written about how to write and maintain makefiles, and they can be an incredibly powerful tool.

## Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging

- If your program runs but doesn’t work correctly, then it’s time for some **debugging** to figure out what’s wrong.
