# 2.7 — Programs with multiple code files

## Adding files to your project

- As programs get larger, it is common to **split them into multiple files** for organizational or reusability purposes.

- When you add new code files to your project, give them a **.cpp extensio**n.

- When you compile your program, you’ll need to **include all of the relevant code files on the compile  line**. For example: `g++ main.cpp add.cpp -o main`, where `main.cpp` and `add.cpp` are the **names of your code files**, and `main` is the **name of the output file**.

- The compiler compiles each file **individually** and uses **linker** to link them together.
- Since the compiler **doesn't know the existence of functions from another code file**, we have to first put **forward declarations** for those functions in our **main code file**.

## Summary

- When the compiler compiles a multi-file program, it may compile the files **in any order**.
- Compiler compiles each file **individually**, with **no knowledge of what is in other files.**

- Whenever you create a new code (.cpp) file, you will need to **add it to your compiling command** so that it gets compiled.
