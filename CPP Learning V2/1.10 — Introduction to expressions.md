# 1.10 â€” Introduction to expressions

## Expressions

- An **expression** is a **combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls** that can be executed to produce **a singular value**.
- The **process of executing an expression** is called **evaluation**
- The single value produced by evaluating an expression is called **the result of the expression**.

- Each of the terms inside the expression are evaluated, **until a single value remains**. 

  - **Literals** evaluate to **their own values**.

  - **Variables** evaluate to **the value of the variable**. 

  - **Function calls** evaluate to **whatever value the function returns**.

  - **Operators** let us **combine multiple values together** to produce a new value.

- Expressions **do not end in a semicolon**, and **cannot be compiled by themselves**. 
- Expressions are always evaluated **as part of statements**.

## Expression statements

- An **expression statement** is a statement that consists of **an expression followed by a semicolon**. 
- When the expression statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated and **the result of the expression will be discarded**.
