Hello! This is Melvin from Malaysia, the country right to the north of Singapore, and this is a reply to your introduction video. As a native Chinese speaker, I was shocked by your accurate Mandarin Chinese pronunciation. As far as I know, Chinese is one of the most complex languages for English speakers to learn as it contains thousands of unique characters and each of them has its special meanings and pronunciation. With that being said, let me do a quick introduction of myself. I'm 17 years old as well, currently studying at Foon Yew High School, one of the largest Chinese Independent High Schools in Southeast Asia, located in Johor, the southernmost state in the Malayan Peninsula. I'm Malaysian Chinese, so please don't mind my weird English accent. I'm recording this video in English since I'm afraid that I will use some fancy Chinese words that you might not understand so well if I record this video in Chinese, so it's better to use a language that both of us understand well. But still, I'm so glad that you have a great interest in learning Chinese. By the way, as far as the school authority told me, we'll be able to exchange our contact before a real-life conversation is held. To be frank, it's pretty cool that we can get to know each other better beforehand to avoid any awkwardness during the conversation. Until then, looking forward to meeting you in person!
