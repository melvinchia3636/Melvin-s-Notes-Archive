Ang: What's up, dude!

Mel: Hey! How's everything going?

Ang: Not too bad!

Mel: Glad to hear that! So... I've recently stumbled upon some images of greenery scenery on Facebook, and those images made me think: will our offspring still be able to see these kinds of scenery after a few decades from now?

Ang: Of course they will! Won't they?

Mel: Well... You know, if human-beings keep destroying this planet, these kind of greenery will arguably disappear in the forseeable future.

Ang: Ohh yeah... You're right. Industrialization of the modern world is definitely the culprit.

Mel: Exactly. Factories increasingly emitting a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases since the past few decades. Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide... You named it. All of these leads to serious ozone depletion, and intensifies the global warming crisis. Do you know what I mean?

Ang: Yeah totally. If I interpret correctly, global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the entire earth, right?

Mel: That's correct.

Ang: That means, those enormous glaciers, especially in Antarctica, will start melting, the sea level will rise, and lots of people will lose their homes???

Mel: I'm afraid that you're right...

Ang: That's catastrophic! We might have to take action as soon as possible. What do you suggest?

Mel: Yeah... In my point of view, since we're dealing with the big companies behind those factories, the government will be ideal for tackling them.

Ang: Ahh I see... So that means the government can legislate to limit the emission of greenhouse gases?

Mel: Absolutely. If only all countries in the world can form a consensus on this topic.

Ang: That's true... But if I'm not wrong, there are numerous international organizations aimed to solve the climates issues we're facing right now.

Mel: Yeah, hopefully, they will be of some help.

Ang: Let's hope for the best. So... I wonder if there is any other cause of global warming?

Mel: There surely is. You see, CARs are also a considerably big issue.

Ang: Ohh yeahhhhhh... The gases they're emitting!

Mel: Yup exactly. So the best solution of this issue? As you might already know, the public transportation system.

Ang: Totally agree with you.

Mel: Okay, enough for that. Let's change the subject. Recently I went to Pinang by bus for a family trip. During the course of it, I saw trucks upon trucks loaded with logs passing by, and the more I thought about it, the more I worried. What if someday, all the trees are gone?

Ang: That will definitely be a true disaster.

Mel: Yup... deforesation.

Ang: Animals losing their home, climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and so on. Ahhh... I can't even imagine!

Mel: I reckon that all of these are attributed to the intemperance of lumbering.

Ang: I am of the same opinion as you. Well... the government has to do something about it.

Mel: Yeah... All and all, the world would've been a much better place without the existence of human. Joking aside, if every single human being on earth can take their responsibility as an earthling, human civilization will certainly live forever.

Ang: I'm absolutely agree with you.

Mel: That's it for today I guess. I gotta go and have my lunch. See you in a bit.

Ang: See ya!
