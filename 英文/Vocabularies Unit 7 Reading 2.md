My uncle has a 1974 Ferrari Dino 308 - 'a thing of beauty, a joy forever,' so a poet once said. It's the perfect balance of engineering and design. The noise it makes as it pulls away, it's set my heart racing. A flash of Ferrari red and it's gone.

Fading light. The last gasp of the day. On Earth, colours lose thier hold as the sky above drains them. Crimson, rose, blood red. On Earch, I watch in awe. The sun takes its farewell and dips behind the horizon. I leave, wondering what new beauties the day to come will bring.

He turns, he stops, he turns and runs. He stops and turns again.

No two moves are the same.

He looks up, he looks down,

He looks forwards, he looks round.

Will he pass? Will he shoot? Will he turn again?

As I watch my cat feed her hungry kittens, all eight of them, each fighting for a space, I think about the miracle of life - how well it all works, how well it all fits together. It gives me goosebumps down mya rm and inside I purr. Does anything get more perfect?

I'm sitting here, head in hand. There is n room left in my head. it's ready to explode.And then the bell sounds, loud and welcome. The sound echoes ... echoes through the corridors. Happy children put down their pens and wait for the words, simple but beautiful: 'Off you go.'

I live by the sea. Where else is there to live? The sea fills my heart with joy. A big blue expanse of happiness. The crashing waves, obeying no one, come and then go. I always return to the sea. It knows the answers before I even ask the questions.

Halfway through Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, there's a guitar solo that sends shivers down my spine. Even through I know it'scoming, it gets me every time. It brings a tear to my eye and reminds me what better palace the world is for music.

'Hello, I'm home.' It brings a smile to my face when I hear my wife's voice. I look up and she's there. Has she walked out of a ppainting? 'She is beauty,' is all I think.

我的叔叔有一台1974年的法拉利Dino 308 —— “一个漂亮的东西，一个永恒的快乐”，一个诗人曾经说道。这是一个工程与设计的完美平衡。它驶离时所发出的声音，令我心跳加速。一抹法拉利红从眼前闪过，它便消失了。

逐渐暗淡的光。一天的最后一次喘息。在地球上，颜色随着天空将它们慢慢吸干而逐渐失控。赤红色、玫瑰红、血红色。在地球上，我敬畏地看着。太阳告别了大地，逐渐沉入天际线。我离开了，期待着明天会带来什么新的美丽事物。

他改变方向，他停止移动，他扭头就跑。他停下脚步并且再次改变方向。

没有哪个动作是重复的。

他抬头，他俯首，

他看向前方，他看向四周。

他会传球吗？他会射门吗？还是他会再次改变方向？

我看这我的猫正在哺乳它饥饿的幼崽，所有八只幼崽，各自争抢着空间，我思考着生命的奇迹 —— 他们的运作是多么的完美，他们的融合是多么的完美。它让我起了鸡皮疙瘩，猫在我怀里发出咕噜声。还有什么东西是比这更完美的？

我坐在这里，头在手心里。我的脑袋已经没有任何空间。它已经准备爆开。钟声响起，大声且欢迎。那股声音回荡着 ... 回荡着穿过走廊。开心的孩子们放下手中的笔并等待那句话，那句简单且漂亮的话：“去吧。”

我住在海边。还有哪里可以居住？大海让我的内心充满喜悦。一个广大且蔚蓝的快乐之情。那拍打的海浪，不服从任何人，来了又去。我一直回到大海。他在我提出问题之前便已经知道了答案。

聆听平克·弗洛伊德的*Wish You Were Here*到一半时，有一个吉他独奏会让我背脊发凉。虽然我知道它即将到来，他依然每次都让我这样。它让我泪目，提醒着我在音乐的世界里更棒的地方是什么。

“哈咯，我回来了。”每当听到我爱妻的声音，它总是让我为之一笑。我抬起头，她就在那儿。她是从画作中走出来的吗？我满脑袋只想着，“她真漂亮”。
