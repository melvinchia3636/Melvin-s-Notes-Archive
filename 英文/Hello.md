Hello. I am Melvin Chia, a student from senior 2 Commerce 1 who has a great interest in math and code. I used to do pretty poorly in English. It was not until the Covid 19 pandemic that we were forced to stay home, which gave me a lot of free time. I decided to use my time wisely and started learning how to code. Since most online tutorials and resources are written in English, I forced myself to understand them. And without me realizing it, I learned a bunch of new vocabulary that soon allowed me to express my thoughts in English without being bothered. But of course, that wasn't enough until I put what I had learned into practice. I then decided to step out of my comfort zone and tried to have text conversations with my friends and even some foreigners, which has worked out quite well so far. Still, I can never ignore the most important part of a language - speaking. Even though I had watched countless videos of YouTubers whose native language is English, I have never had the opportunity to talk to someone face-to-face in English. Therefore, I am looking forward to this unique opportunity to speak with native English speakers in real life and further improve my English skills even more, as well as overcome my social anxiety.
