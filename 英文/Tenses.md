### Simple Present Tense

#### Form

We use the **base form** of the verb, and add ***-s*** for the third person singular.

|                   | I, you, we, they       | he, she, it                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Positive          | I work.                | It works.                  |
| Negative          | I do not (don't) work. | It does not (doesn't) work |
| Question Positive | do you work?           | does he work?              |
| Question Negative | don't you work?        | doesn't she work?          |

#### Spelling

For most verbs we add ***-s*** to the base form to make the ***she, he, it* (third person singular)** form:

| Examples     |                  |                  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| come → comes | order → ordes    | travel → travels |
| eat → eats   | record → records | walk → walks     |
| move → moves |                  |                  |

For other verbs, the spelling changes are:
