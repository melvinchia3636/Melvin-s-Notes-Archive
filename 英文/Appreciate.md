I am desperate to express my sincere appreciation to my father. He is the one who is always there when I need support, both physical and spiritual. He is the one who has been with me through the darkest time of my life. He is the one who made me who I am today.

During my time in elementary school, things were pretty rough. I was bullied by my classmates, and shockingly, even some teachers contributed to the problem. I felt completely powerless, and at one point, I even thought about giving it all up. Despite my efforts to address the issue, nothing seemed to change.

My father was my lifeline in those days. He understood what I was going through and told me the only way to cope was to change my thinking style since we couldn't control the external factors. It took a while, but I finally understood the wisdom of his words when I entered junior high school.

You might think that things would have gotten better when I got to junior high school, but that's only partially true. Bullying still happened, but the difference was that I had learned to ignore it and move on with my life. I owe that resilience to my father, who stood by me with his advice every time I confided in him.

Thanks to him, I've learned to approach life's challenges optimistically, no matter how difficult they may seem. I've figured out how to deal with people who try to make fun of me, even when their words hurt. And I've also mastered the art of keeping my cool even when I'm frustrated. His simple but effective advice has made me a stronger, more confident person, and for that, I'm eternally grateful.
