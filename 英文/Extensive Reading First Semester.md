## What makes me choose this article?

I've always been a great fan of Elon Musk - the richest and the craziest man in the world. He owns Tesla - the largest electric car company, SpaceX - the most well-known aerospace manufacturer in the world, and a lot of other weird companies spreading in different fields. Recently, he tweeted a message asking the price of Twitter, and immediately after that, news claiming that he decided to buy the entire Twitter started popping up all over the Internet. Frankly speaking, my min was blown up by this ridiculous decision that he's made, thus I decided to take this opportunity of extensive reading to write about this topic.

## My perspective

Twitter has been one of the most influential social media platforms for decades. Countless political figures and celebrities have been using it to express their thoughts. Regrettably, Twitter has stepped up its censorship over the past few years. This is undoubtedly a severe crackdown on freedom of speech. Elon Musk evidently realized the consequences of a lack of freedom of speech and decided to purchase Twitter, claiming he would make Twitter a safe place for free speech. Personally speaking, even though I rarely use Twitter, I'm still happy to hear that the freedom of speech is yet again being defended.
