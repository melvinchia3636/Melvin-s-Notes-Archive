The earth on which humans and numerous other living creatures live is gigantic yet complicated. Albeit having developed advanced civilizations and technologies, there are still approximately 65% of the earth remains undiscovered by humans. I have heard many stories about Nessie in the past. Some claim it is real, while others say it was made up merely to attract public attention. In my point of view, there could be an unknown creature living under Loch Ness, but it certainly will not be a giant eel. Well, let us assume that there really is a giant eel living in Loch Ness, then there must be a sufficient food source for it to survive. However, according to recent scientific studies, there are hardly any fish there. So does Nessie really exist? Since there is only one blurry image of her on the Internet, and we are not certain whether or not this image was synthesized, I do not think there is enough evidence for her existence. Nevertheless, the mystery remains, and we'll leave it to the scientists to solve it.
