\chapter {Tangent Vectors and Normal Vectors}

Let $C$ be a smooth curve represented by $\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\hat{\imath} +
    y(t)\hat{\jmath} + z(t)\hat{k}$ on an open interval $I$, the unit tangent
vector at $t = a$ is a vector that is tangent to the curve at $t = a$ and has a
magnitude of $1$. The unit tangent vector is given by \[\vec{T}(t) = \frac{(\vec{r})'(t)}{\lVert(\vec{r})'(t)\rVert} = \frac{x'(t)\hat{\imath} + y'(t)\hat{\jmath} + z'(t)\hat{k}}{\sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2}}, \quad (\vec{r})'(t) \neq \vec{0}\]
