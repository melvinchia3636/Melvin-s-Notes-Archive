    \section{Longitude and Latitude}

    The earth is approximately spherical in shape, its radius is about $6,370km$,
    and its axis is a line that passes through the north ({$N$}) and south ($S$)
    poles. The earth rotating around its axis once is called a day, and the earth
    rotating around the sun once is called a year.

    Any point on the earth's surface can be identified by two angles, the first is
    the angle between the point and the equator, called the \emph{latitude} of the
    point, and the second is the angle between the point and the prime meridian,
    called the \emph{longitude} of the point.

    \subsection*{Longitude and Lines of Longitude}

    The two semicircles that are formed by the intersection of the earth's surface
    with the plane that passes through the north and south poles are called the
    \emph{lines of longitude}, also called \emph{meridians}. The lines of longitude
    that passes through the \emph{Greenwich Observatory} in England are considered
    as $0^{\circ}$ longitude, called the \emph{Greenwich Meridian} or \emph{prime
        meridian}.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{primemeridian}
    \end{center}

    The angle between the Greenwich Meridian and the line of longitude that passes
    through the point $P$ is called the \emph{longitude of $P$}. There are 360
    degrees of longitude ($+180^\circ$ eastward and $-180^\circ$ westward.). The
    prime meridian divides the world into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western
    Hemisphere. $180^{\circ}E$ and $180^{\circ}W$ coincide with each other at the
    same line of longitude, called the \emph{$180^{th}$ Meridian} or
    \emph{Antimeridian}.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.4]{longitude.png}
    \end{center}

    \subsection*{Latitude and Parallels of Latitude}

    The lines of latitude are the circles that are perpendicular to the plane that
    passes through the north and south poles. The \emph{equator} is the one and
    only great circle among the parallels of latitude.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{latitude}
    \end{center}

    The angle between the equator and the line of latitude that passes through the
    point $P$ is called the \emph{latitude of $P$}. There are 180 degrees of
    latitude ($+90^\circ$ northward and $-90^\circ$ southward). The equator divides
    the world into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{latitude 2.png}
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Practice 3}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In the diagram below, $NGS$ is the prime meridian, $O$ is the centre of the
              earth. Find the longitude of locations $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $T$.
              \begin{center}
                  \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{p3q1.png}
              \end{center}
        \item In the diagram below, $O$ is the centre of the earth, location $A$ and $B$ are
              on the equator. Find the location of $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $T$.
              \begin{center}
                  \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{p3q2.png}
              \end{center}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection*{Radius of the Parallel of Latitude}

    Let $R$ be the radius of the earth, $r$ be the radius of latitude $\theta$,
    then $r = R \cos \theta$.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{radius of latitude.png}
    \end{center}

    \subsection*{Nautical Miles}

    The arc length corresponding to $1'$ ($=\frac{1}{60}^\circ$) of the great
    circle on earth is called a \emph{nautical mile} ($1$\emph{NM}), that is,
    $1\text{\emph{NM}} = \frac{1}{60 \times 360} \times 2\pi \times 6370km =
        1.853km$.

    \subsection*{Time Difference and Longitude}

    The time is calculated by the rotation of the earth around its axis. The earth
    rotates around its axis from west to east once in $24h$. That is, the earth
    rotates $15^\circ$ in $1h$. Thus, the time difference between two locations on
    the earth is equal to the difference of their longitudes. Thus, the time
    difference is $1hr$ per $15^\circ$ of longitude difference.

    \begin{enumerate}[listparindent=1.5em]
        \item \textbf{Local Time}\\
              The local time is the time at a location on the earth. The local time for any location on the same line of longitude is the same.
        \item \textbf{Standard Time}\\
              Back in the year $1844$, International Meridian Conference was held in Washington DC. The conference decided to divide the world into 24 time zones based on the Greenwich Meridian, called the \emph{Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT)}. There is zero time offset $7.5^\circ$ eastward and $7.5^\circ$ westward of the Greenwich Meridian. The time offset is $1hr$ per $15^\circ$ of longitude difference. All places in the same time zone share the same local time with the location located on the line of longitude that passes through the centre of the time zone, called the \emph{standard time} or \emph{zone time}.

              \indent When entering a new time zone from the east, the local time is advanced by
              $1hr$ per $15^\circ$ of longitude difference. When entering a new time zone
              from the west, the local time is delayed by $1hr$ per $15^\circ$ of longitude
              difference.

    \section{Distance of Two Locations on the Same Line of Longitude}

    The distance of two location on the same line of longitude is the arc length
    corresponding to the difference of their latitudes. Given two location $P$ and
    $Q$ on the same line of longitude, according to the definition of nautical
    mile, the distance between $P$ and $Q$ can be acquired by the arc length of
    $PQ$. That is, $\overset{\frown}{PQ} = \theta \times 60$\emph{NM}, where
    $\theta$ is the difference of their latitudes.

              of the equator. Based on the following criteria, find the latitude of $Q$:
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \item $Q$ is located at the north of $P$

              \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Distance of Two Locations on the Same Parallel of Latitude}

    The distance between two locations on the same parallel of latitude is the arc
    length on the parallel of latitude corresponding to the difference of their
    longitudes.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.4]{latitude difference.png}
    \end{center}

    In the diagram above, $P$ and $Q$ are on the same parallel of latitude
    $\theta$, their difference of latitude is $\alpha$. $A$ and $B$ are locations
    on the equator.

    Given that $\angle PKQ = \angle AOB = \alpha$. Let $R$ be the radius of the
    earth, $r$ be the radius of the parallel of latitude.

    \begin{flalign*}
        \frac{\overset{\frown}{PQ}}{\overset{\frown}{AB}} & = \frac{\frac{\alpha}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r}{\frac{\alpha}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi R} \\
                                                          & = \frac{r}{R}                                                                           \\
    \end{flalign*}

    From the radius of the the parallel of latitude $r = R \cos R$, we have
    $\frac{r}{R} = \cos \theta$.
    \begin{flalign*}
        \therefore \frac{\overset{\frown}{PQ}}{\overset{\frown}{AB}} & = \cos \theta                                             \\
        \overset{\frown}{PQ}                                         & = \overset{\frown}{AB} \times \cos \theta                 \\
                                                                     & = \alpha \times 60 \times \cos \theta \text{\emph{NM} or} \\
                                                                     & = \alpha \times 60 \times \cos \theta \times 1.853km
    \end{flalign*}

                  \item $X(40^\circ N, 28^\circ 15' E), Y(40^\circ N, 42^\circ 45' W)$
                  \item $K(20^\circ S, 160^\circ E), L(20^\circ S, 140^\circ W)$
              \end{enumerate}
