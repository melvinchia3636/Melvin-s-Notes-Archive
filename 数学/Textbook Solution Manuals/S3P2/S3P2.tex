\section*{Author's Note}

Now, having an INTP (logician) type of personality, I tend to procrastinate a
lot. This fact is officially proven and is definitely not my excuse for taking
so long to finish this book. After half a year of procrastination, I finally
got into flow mode and finished writing the book. Finishing this book signifies
the end of my high school math journey. It also means that I have worked on
every single question in my Senior 2 and Senior 3 textbooks.

Over the past few months, I have gotten a sneak peek at Calculus 3, and to be
honest, it's the most interesting part of Calculus I have ever seen compared to
the basic Calculus covered in the high school curriculum. Speaking of which,
this book covers the application of differentiation and some basic integral
calculus, which is the last topic in the high school curriculum.

Translating an entire book while solving all the problems in it was undoubtedly
fun. Not only can it drastically improve my English writing skills, but it can
also help me brush up on my math knowledge or dive into new areas of math.
However, it is very tiring to concentrate for many hours without interruption.
The future is undoubtedly unpredictable. No one knows whether I'll write any
more books in the future, not even me.

Incidentally, I've decided to make this book a little different from the
previous ones by including my own manuscripts in the appendix, which I wrote
back in class when I was really bored. These manuscripts, which total over 50
pages, cover all of the problems in Chapter 26 except for the revision
exercises, and part of Chapter 27, since the latter problems require graph
sketching which I was too lazy to do by hand.

All kidding aside, I changed the title of this chapter from "Why this book?" to
"Author's Notes" because it should be clear to you why this book exists, right?

\section*{Disclaimer}

This book is not intended as a replacement for the official textbook. It is
merely my own solution book for the official textbook. It is not guaranteed
that all solutions are correct (believe me, there are a bunch of silly
mistakes), and there might be a few grammatical errors here and there. Also,
there may be some things missing that I forgot to include. I am not responsible
for the consequences of using this book. And please, do NOT copy my solutions
and pass them off as your own. You will not learn anything by doing so. Lastly,
please don't mind the ugly graphics in this book. I was too lazy to draw them
in LaTeX and just took photos of them from the textbook.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank myself for the fact that I hesitated so long to finish
this book. My special thanks go to my bed and my workplace, which provide me
with a pleasant working environment. I would also like to thank my friends for
providing me with an unlimited supply of motivation during my journey through
math.
