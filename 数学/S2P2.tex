  \chapter{Statistics}

  \section{Basic Concepts}

  Statistics mainly study how to collect, organize, summarize, and interpret
  data. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis,
  interpretation, and presentation of data. It is used to answer questions about
  the data and to make decisions based on the data.

  \subsection*{Population and Sample}

  In statistics, a population is the entire group of individuals that we are
  studying, and the units that form a population are called individuals or
  elements. A sample is a subset of the population. The number of elements in a
  sample is called the sample size. For example: select 20 of the 4,000 senior
  high school mathematics UEC exam papers and record their scores:
  \begin{flalign*}
    72 \qquad 80 \qquad 96 \qquad 20 \qquad 42 \\
    75 \qquad 60 \qquad 92 \qquad 18 \qquad 53 \\
    82 \qquad 77 \qquad 53 \qquad 29 \qquad 34 \\
    57 \qquad 79 \qquad 82 \qquad 90 \qquad 41
  \end{flalign*}
  Here, the population is the 4,000 scores, each of which is an element of the population. The sample is the 20 scores, the sample size is 20.

  \subsection*{Census and Sample Survey}

  The way of surveying can be divided into two types: census and sample survey. A
  census is a survey in which every element of the population is included in the
  sample. For example: national census. The data collected in a census is more
  accurate and reliable, but it is very expensive and time-consuming.

  A sample survey is a survey in which only a part of the population is included
  in the sample. Researchers can use a sample survey to estimate the
  characteristics of the population. For example: a light bulb manufacturer
  produces a lot of light bulbs, thus it is impossible to test every single light
  bulb. The manufacturer can randomly select a sample of light bulbs and test
  them.

  \section{Data Processing}

  Data that are collected must be processed before they can be analyzed.

  \subsection*{Frequency Distribution}

  When the possible values of a dataset are not too many, we can use a frequency
  distribution table to organize the data. The frequency distribution table is a
  table that shows the frequency of each value in a dataset. The frequency of a
  value is the number of times that value appears in the dataset.

  When there are too many possible values, we must group the values into classes.
  Before grouping the values, we must first determine the range of the values,
  aka the difference between the largest and smallest values, then determine the
  number of classes. The number of classes should be determined according to the
  purpose of the study and the identity of the data. After classifying the data,
  the range of each group is called the class interval. Typically, the class
  interval is the same for all classes, and must be greater than the number of
  classes divided by the range of the data. After the number and interval of the
  classes are determined, we can arrange the frequency of each class in a
  frequency distribution table.

  Take 100 sample from a population of some kind of component, their weight (in
  $g$), are as below:
  \begin{flalign*}
    1.36 & \qquad 1.49 \qquad 1.43 \qquad 1.41 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.40 \\
    1.32 & \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.47 \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.41 \qquad 1.36 \\
    1.40 & \qquad 1.34 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.45 \qquad 1.35 \\
    1.42 & \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.44 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.42 \\
    1.42 & \qquad 1.30 \qquad 1.34 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.36 \\
    1.37 & \qquad 1.34 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.44 \qquad 1.45 \\
    1.32 & \qquad 1.48 \qquad 1.40 \qquad 1.45 \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.46 \\
    1.39 & \qquad 1.53 \qquad 1.36 \qquad 1.48 \qquad 1.40 \qquad 1.39 \\
    1.38 & \qquad 1.40 \qquad 1.36 \qquad 1.45 \qquad 1.50 \qquad 1.43 \\
    1.38 & \qquad 1.43 \qquad 1.41 \qquad 1.48 \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.45
  \end{flalign*}
  \begin{flalign*}
    1.37 & \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.39 \qquad 1.45 \qquad 1.31 \qquad 1.41 \\
    1.44 & \qquad 1.44 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.47 \qquad 1.35 \qquad 1.36 \\
    1.39 & \qquad 1.40 \qquad 1.38 \qquad 1.35 \qquad 1.38 \qquad 1.43 \\
    1.42 & \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.40 \qquad 1.41 \qquad 1.37 \\
    1.46 & \qquad 1.36 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.27 \qquad 1.37 \qquad 1.38 \\
    1.42 & \qquad 1.34 \qquad 1.43 \qquad 1.42 \qquad 1.41 \qquad 1.41 \\
    1.44 & \qquad 1.48 \qquad 1.55 \qquad 1.39
  \end{flalign*}

  In the dataset above, the minimum value is $1.27$ and the maximum value is
  $1.55$.

  $\therefore $ The range of the data is $1.55 - 1.27 = 0.28$.

  If we classify the data into 10 classes, then the class interval must be
  greater than $\frac{0.28}{10} = 0.028$. Thus, we can use a class interval of
  $0.03$.

  Let the lower limit of the first class be $1.27$, then the lower limit of the
  second class is $1.27 + 0.03 = 1.30$.

  Since all the values in the dataset are of 2 decimal places, the upper limit of
  the first class is should be $1.29$. By the same logic, we can get all the
  classes: $1.27 - 1.29$, $1.30 - 1.32$, $\cdots$, $1.54 - 1.56$.

  Now we can arrange the data into the frequency distribution table:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
      Weight $m$($g$) & Frequency \\
      \hline
      $1.27 - 1.29$   & 1         \\
      $1.30 - 1.32$   & 4         \\
      $1.33 - 1.35$   & 7         \\
      $1.36 - 1.38$   & 22        \\
      $1.39 - 1.41$   & 24        \\
      $1.42 - 1.44$   & 24        \\
      $1.45 - 1.47$   & 10        \\
      $1.48 - 1.50$   & 6         \\
      $1.51 - 1.53$   & 1         \\
      $1.54 - 1.56$   & 1         \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  In the example above, we assume that the weight of the components is accurate
  to 2 decimal places. Hence, if a component has a weight of $1.443g$, it is
  rounded to $1.44g$, thus it belongs to the class $1.42 - 1.44$. Hence, the
  actual range of the first class $1.27 - 1.29$ is $1.265 \leq m < 1.295$,
  written as $1.265 - 1.295$, while $1.265$ and $1.295$ are the boundaries of the
  first class, $1.265$ is the lower boundary and $1.295$ is the upper boundary.
  The mean of the lower boundary and upper boundary of a class is called the
  class midpoint. For example, the class midpoint of the first class is
  $\frac{1.265 + 1.295}{2} = 1.28$.

  When we are analyzing the data data that have been classified into classes, the
  midpoint of each class is used as the representative value of the class. Thus,
  we should try our best to make the data-intensive place the group midpoint when
  choosing the class interval and boundaries, so that the data can be analyzed
  more precisely.

  The distribution of frequency can be represented by a histogram or a frequency
  polygon.

  The histogram is a row of continuous bars, the bottom side of each bar on the
  x-axis. For unclassified data, the bottom side of each bar is marked with the
  values, while the height of each bar is the frequency of the corresponding
  value. For classified data, the bottom side of each bar is marked with the
  boundaries of the corresponding class, while the area of each bar must be
  proportional to the frequency of the corresponding class. When the class
  interval of each class is the same, we can use the frequency of each class as
  the height of the bar.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
      \begin{axis}[
          title=\Large{Histogram},
          ymin=0, ymax=16,
          ytick={0, 2, ..., 16},
          xlabel=Data, ylabel=Frequency,
          ybar interval,
          grid=none,
          xtick style={draw=none},
        ]
        \addplot+[draw=black, style={fill=gray!40},mark=no] plot coordinates { (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 11) (3, 14) (4, 11) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) };
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  The frequency polygon is a continuous line graph, the x-axis is the midpoint of
  each class, and the y-axis is the frequency of each class. To draw a frequency
  polygon, we plot each point, including the point before the first class and the
  point after the last class that uses $0$ as their frequency, and then connect
  the points with a continuous line.

  \subsection*{Cumulative Frequency Distribution}

  Summing up the frequency of each class, we obtain the cumulative frequency
  distribution. Use the upper boundary of each class as the x-axis, and the
  cumulative frequency as the y-axis, we can draw the cumulative frequency
  distribution by plotting each point including the point before the first class
  that uses 0 as its frequency and connect them together. If we split the x-axis
  and the higest point of the curve into 100 equal parts, we get the percentage
  of the cumulative frequency distribution.

    \item If the average mark of a student is 72, find his rank in the class. \sol{}

          In the graph above, we can see that there are approximately 92 students who
          have an average mark lower than 72. Therefore, the rank of the student is $155
            - 92 = 63$.

    \item If the top $20\%$ of the class are to be awarded a certificate, find the
          minimum average mark required for the certificate. \sol{}
          \begin{flalign*}
            \text{Top $20\%$} & = 20\% \times 155 \\
                              & = 31
          \end{flalign*}
          Therefore, students with an average mark corresponding to cumulative frequency higher than 124 will be awarded a certificate.

          In the graph above, The minimum average mark required for the certificate is
          76.

                  In the diagram above, there are approximately $1200 - 155 = 1045$ students
                  whose score is greater or equal to $38$, which is about $\frac{1045}{1200}

                  If the percentage of students who pass the exam is $90\%$, then the number of

                  is $15\%$ of $1200$ students, which is $180$ students. That means, there are
                  $1200 - 180 = 1020$ students who are not categorised as \textit{Excellent}.

                  In the diagram above, the minimum mark of a student who is categorised as
                  \textit{Excellent} is about $75$ given that there are $1020$ students who are
                  not categorised as \textit{Excellent}.

  \section{Central Tendency}

  Central tendency is a measure of the central position of a distribution, or a
  single value that attempts to describe a set of data. The most common measures
  of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.

  \subsection*{Mean}

  Mean is also known as arithmetic mean. For $n$ values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$,
  the mean is defined as \makeatletter \setbool{@fleqn}{false} \makeatother
  \begin{flalign*}
    \bar{x} & = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \\
            & = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
  \end{flalign*}
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{true}
  \makeatother

  For data whose possible values are $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, and their
  respective frequencies are $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$, the mean is defined as
  \makeatletter \setbool{@fleqn}{false} \makeatother
  \begin{flalign*}
    \bar{x} & = \frac{x_1f_1 + x_2f_2 + \cdots + x_nf_n}{f_1 + f_2 + \cdots + f_n} \\
            & = \frac{\sum f_i x_i}{\sum f_i}
  \end{flalign*}
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{true}
  \makeatother

  For grouped data, we take the mean of each class as the representative value
  $x_i$ of the class.

  \subsubsection*{Weighted Mean}

  In some scenario, weighted mean is better than the mean to describe the data.

  When calculating the arithmetic mean, each value is given equal weight.
  However, in some cases, each value in a dataset may not be equally important.
  For example, the importance of the mark of a student for each subject is
  weighted according to the number of classes of the subject in a week. Hence,
  when calculating the average mark of the student, each mark must be multiplied
  by a value that represents the importance of the subject, and that value is
  called the weight. The weighted mean is defined as \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{false} \makeatother
  \begin{flalign*}
    \bar{x} & = \frac{w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_n x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \cdots + w_n} \\
            & = \frac{\sum w_i x_i}{\sum w_i}
  \end{flalign*}
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{true}
  \makeatother
  where $x_i$ are the values and $w_i$ are the weights of $x_i$.

  \subsection{Practice 3}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the mean of 34, 50, 24, 32, 53, 30, 62, 27. \sol{}
          \begin{flalign*}
            \bar{x} & = \frac{30 + 50 + 24 + 32 + 53 + 30 + 62 + 27}{8} \\
                    & = \frac{312}{8}                                   \\
                    & = 39
          \end{flalign*}

    \item There are three workshop $A$, $B$, and $C$ in a factory. Workshop $A$ has 10
          workers, their wages are $\$35$ per day, workshop $B$ has 30 workers, their
          wages are $\$45$ per day, and workshop $C$ has 15 workers, their wages are
          $\$55$ per day. Find the mean of the wages of the workers in the factory.
          \sol{}

          Let the wages of workers be $x_1$, and the amount of workers be $f_1$.
          \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
              \hline
              $x_1$ & $f_1$           & $x_1f_1$              \\
              \hline
              35    & 10              & 350                   \\
              45    & 30              & 1350                  \\
              55    & 15              & 825                   \\
              \hline
                    & $\sum f_i = 55$ & $\sum f_i x_i = 2525$ \\
              \hline
            \end{tabular}
          \end{center}
          $\therefore $ Average wages of workers in the factory is $\frac{2525}{55} = \$45.91$.

  \subsection*{Median}

  The median is the middle value of a sorted dataset. The number of values must
  be equal for both side of the median.

  If the number of values is $n$, when $n$ is odd, the median is the number in
  $\frac{n+1}{2}$ position.\\ When $n$ is even, the median is the mean of the
  number in $\frac{n}{2}$ and $\frac{n}{2}+1$ position.

  For grouped data, we can make a cumulative frequency polygon, and the median is
  the value corresponding to $50\%$ of the percentage of the cumulative
  frequency.
  \begin{flalign*}
    \text{Let } & n \text{ be the number of values in the dataset, aka }\sum f_1, & \\
                & L_m \text{ be the lower boundaries of the group of the median,}   \\
                & C_m \text{ be the range of the group of the median,}              \\
                & f_m \text{ be the frequency of the group of the median,}          \\
                & F_m \text{ be the cum. frequency of the group of the median,}
  \end{flalign*}

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  Diagram above shows a part of a cumulative frequency polygon, where $R$ is the
  point corresponding to the group containing the median, $P$ is the point
  corresponding to the group before the group containing the median, and $M$ is
  the median. Since $\Delta PQR \sim \Delta PST$,
  \begin{flalign*}
    \therefore \frac{PS}{PQ}             & = \frac{ST}{QR}                 \\
    \text{That is, } \frac{M - L_m}{C_m} & = \frac{\frac{n}{2} - F_m}{f_m}
  \end{flalign*}
  We get the following after simplifying the equation:
  \begin{cequation}
    M = L_m + \left(\frac{\frac{n}{2} - F_m}{f_m}\right)C_m
  \end{cequation}

  \subsection{Practice 4}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 10 workers in a factory made the same type of product in a day, the number of products made are as follows:
          \begin{flalign*}
            15 & \qquad 17 \qquad 14 \qquad 10 \qquad 15 \\
            19 & \qquad 17 \qquad 16 \qquad 14 \qquad 12
          \end{flalign*}
          Find the median of the number of products made by these 10 workers.
          \sol{}

          Sort the dataset:
          \begin{cequation}
            10 \quad 12 \quad 14 \quad 14 \quad 15 \quad 15 \quad 16 \quad 17 \quad 17 \quad 19
          \end{cequation}

          The median is the mean of the number in $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ and $\frac{10}{2}+1
            = 6$ position, which is $\frac{15 + 15}{2} = 15$.

  \subsection*{Mode}

  In a set of data, the mode is the value that occurs most frequently. There can
  be more than one mode in a set of data. If all the values in a dataset occur
  with the same frequency, then there is no mode for the data.

  For grouped data, the mode is the class that has the highest frequency, and
  there can be more than one mode. Besides that, the mode can also be estimated
  using histogram. The method is as follows:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
      \begin{axis}[
          ymin=0, ymax=16,
          ticks=none,
          ybar interval,
          grid=none,
          xtick style={draw=none},
          axis x line*=bottom,
          axis y line*=left,
        ]
        \addplot[draw=black, style={fill=gray!40},mark=no] plot coordinates { (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 14) (4, 11) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) };
        \draw (axis cs:3, 9) -- (axis cs:4, 14);
        \draw (axis cs:3, 14) -- (axis cs:4, 11);
        \draw [dashed] (axis cs:3.63, 0) -- (axis cs: 3.63, 12);
        \node at (axis cs:3, 9) [above left] {$S$};
        \node at (axis cs:4, 14) [above right] {$Q$};
        \node at (axis cs:3, 14) [above left] {$P$};
        \node at (axis cs:4, 11) [above right] {$R$};
        \draw [|<->|] (axis cs:1.8, 9) -- (axis cs: 1.8, 14) node [midway, fill=white] {$d_1$};
        \draw [|<->|] (axis cs:5.2, 11) -- (axis cs: 5.2, 14) node [midway, fill=white] {$d_2$};
      \end{axis}
      \node at (3.55, -0.4) {$\textit{mode}$};
      \node at (7, 0) [right] {\footnotesize{\textit{Data}}};
      \node at (0, 5.8) [above] {\footnotesize{\textit{Frequency}}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  The diagram above shows a histogram of a set of data. The class corresponding
  to the highest rectangle is the mode of the data, and the mode is the x-value
  of the intersection point of $PR$ and $QS$.

  Unlike median, the formula of mode can be derived from similar triangles. Let:
  \begin{flalign*}
    L   & \text{ be the lower boundaries of the modal class}      \\
    C   & \text{ be the range of the modal class}                 \\
    d_1 & \text{ be the difference between the lower boundary of} \\
        & \text{ the modal class and the lower boundary of the}   \\
        & \text{ class immediately before the modal class}        \\
    d_2 & \text{ be the difference between the lower boundary of} \\
        & \text{ the modal class and the lower boundary of the}   \\
        & \text{ class immediately after the modal class}
  \end{flalign*}
  then
  \begin{cequation}
    \textit{mode} = L + \left(\frac{d_1}{d_1 + d_2}\right)C
  \end{cequation}

  \section{Measures of Dispersion}

  The measures of dispersion can be used to describe the spread of the data.

  When we're describing a set of data, if we only use the mean, the information
  provided by the dataset is not enough. For example, given the mean, median, and
  mode of the average marks of four students in a Mathematics test are all 70
  marks, we can't tell the difference between the four students. Their marks
  might be similar (e.g. 68, 72, 70, 70) or they might be very different (e.g.
  100, 40, 70, 70). The latter case is obviously more spread out than the former
  case.

  The most common measures of dispersion are range, interquartile range, quartile
  deviation, standard deviation, mean deviation, variance, and standard
  deviation.

  \subsubsection*{Range}

  The range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and the
  smallest value in the dataset.

  For grouped data, the range is the difference between the upper limit of the
  highest class and the lower limit of the lowest class.

  \subsection*{Quartile, Interquartile Range, and Quartile Deviation}

  Quartiles are three value $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ that divide a dataset into
  four equal parts. $Q_2$ is the median of the dataset. $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are the
  medians of the two halves of the dataset, called the lower quartile and the
  upper quartile respectively.

  Assume that the number of data in a sorted dataset is $n$. If $n$ is odd, then

  When $n$ is even, split the dataset into two halves, with $n/2$ data in each
  half.

  When $n$ is odd, split the data into two halves after removing the median, with
  $(n-1)/2$ data in each half.

  The median of the lower half is $Q_1$ and the median of the upper half is
  $Q_3$.

  For grouped data, we can make a cumulative frequency polygon. In the percentage
  of the polygon,

  $25\%$ of the data is below $Q_1$.

  $50\%$ of the data is below $Q_2$.

  $75\%$ of the data is below $Q_3$.

  Using the same method of deriving the formula for median, we can derive the
  formula for upper and lower quartiles. Let
  \begin{flalign*}
    n   & \text{ be the number of data in the dataset, aka } \sum f_i \\
    L_k & \text{ be the lower boundaries of the class of } Q_k        \\
    C_k & \text{ be the class range of the class of } Q_k             \\
    f_k & \text{ be the frequency of the class of } Q_k               \\
    F_k & \text{ be the cumulative frequency of the class of } Q_k    \\
  \end{flalign*}
  then
  \begin{cequation}
    Q_1 = L_1 + \left(\frac{\frac{n}{4} - F_1}{f_1}\right)C_1
  \end{cequation}
  \begin{cequation}
    Q_2 = L_2 + \left(\frac{\frac{3n}{4} - F_2}{f_2}\right)C_2
  \end{cequation}

  The difference between the upper and lower quartiles is called the
  interquartile range. That is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \textit{Interquartile range} = Q_3 - Q_1
  \end{cequation}

  The quartile deviation is the interquartile range divided by 2, written as
  $Q.D.$, that is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \textit{Q.D.} = \frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}
  \end{cequation}

  Since the interquartile range and the quartile deviation are not affected by
  the outliers, they are more robust than the range, and are more suitable for
  representing the spread of the data.

              \hline
              Scores   & Number of Students \\
              \hline
              30 - 40  & 3                  \\
              40 - 50  & 4                  \\
              50 - 60  & 13                 \\

            \end{tabular}
          \end{center}
          Find the interquartile deviation of the scores.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection*{Mean Deviation}

  Let the mean of a set of data $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$ be $\bar{x}$, $|x_i
    - \bar{x}|$ is the difference between the $i$th data and the mean, the mean of
  these $n$ differences are called the mean deviation, and can be used to
  calculate the measure of dispersion of the data. That is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \textit{Mean Deviation} = \frac{\sum |x_i - \bar{x}|}{n}
  \end{cequation}

  If the possible value given data are $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$, their
  frequencies are $f_1$, $f_2$, $\ldots$, $f_n$, respectively, then the mean
  deviation can be calculated as follows:
  \begin{cequation}
    \textit{Mean Deviation} = \frac{\sum |x_i - \bar{x}|f_i}{\sum f_i}
  \end{cequation}

  For grouped data, we take the midpoints of the classes as the representative
  value $x_i$.

            \item Find the mean from the frequency distribution table.
            \item Find the mean deviation from the frequency distribution table.
          \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection*{Variance}

  Let the mean of a set of data $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$ be $\bar{x}$,
  ${(x_1 - \bar{x})}^2$ be the square of the difference between the $i^{th}$ data
  and the mean, the square of the mean of these $n$ differences are called the
  variance, written as $\sigma^2$, that is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
  \end{cequation}

  The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation, written as
  $\sigma$, that is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}
  \end{cequation}

  If the possible values of given data are $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$, their
  frequencies are $f_1$, $f_2$, $\ldots$, $f_n$, respectively, then
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2f_i}{\sum f_i}
  \end{cequation}
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2f_i}{\sum f_i}}
  \end{cequation}

  For grouped data, we take the midpoints of the classes as the representative
  value $x_i$.

  The above formula are a bit complicated, so we can simplify the formula:
  \begin{flalign*}
    \sigma^2 & = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2f_i}{\sum f_i}                                  \\
             & = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i - 2\bar{x}\sum x_i f_i + \sum \bar{x}^2 f_i}{\sum f_i} \\
             & = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{\sum f_i} - 2\bar{x}^2 + \bar{x}^2                    \\
             & = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{\sum f_i} - \bar{x}^2
  \end{flalign*}

  Hence, when the frequency of value $x_i$ is $f_i$, Then
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{\sum f_i} - \bar{x}^2
  \end{cequation}
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{\sum f_i} - \bar{x}^2}
  \end{cequation}

  When all the frequencies $f_i$ are equal to $1$, then
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2
  \end{cequation}
  \begin{cequation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum x_i^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2}
  \end{cequation}

  Compared to mean deviation, the variance and standard deviation do not contain
  absolute value, so it is more convenient to use them. Furthermore, the variance
  and standard deviation are more sensitive to the difference between the data
  and the mean, so they are more commonly used in daily life.

  \section{Coefficient of Variation}

  Generally speaking, when we want to compare the variability of two or more sets
  of data, only comparing the standard deviation of each group is not enough. If
  the properties or the units of the data are different, the standard deviation
  of each group must not be comparable. For example, if we want to know whether
  the deviation of the height of students in a class is larger than that of the
  weight of students in the same class, we need a relative metric as the standard
  of comparison, and the coefficient of variation is such a metric. For a
  non-negative set of value, the definition of coefficient of variation is as
  follows:
  \begin{cequation}
    \text{CV} = \frac{\sigma}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%
  \end{cequation}

  From the definition, we can see that the coefficient of variation the standard
  deviation when the mean is 1. Thus, when the coefficient of variation is large,
  it means that the variability of the data is large, and vice versa.

  \subsection{Practice 9}

  In a minor test, the full mark of Chinese language test for senior 2 students
  is 100, its average mark is 70, and the standard deviation is 10, while the
  full mark of Mathematics test is 70, its average mark is 40, and the standard
  deviation is 8. Compare the variability of the two tests.

  \section{Correlation and Correlation Coefficient}

  \subsection*{Correlation}

  In statistics, correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which two
  or more variables move in relation to each other. For example, the correlation
  between the height and weight of a person, the correlation between the price of
  a stock and the volume of the stock traded.

  \subsection*{Scatter Plot}

  A scatter plot is a type of mathematical diagram to show the relationship
  between two variables. Let two groups of data be $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ and
  $y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n$, respectively. The scatter plot of the two groups of
  data is a graph of the points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \cdots, (x_n, y_n)$.

  \subsection*{Linear Correlation}

  If the scatter plot of two groups of data can be approximated by a straight
  line, then the two groups of data are said to be linearly correlated. According
  to the trend of the two groups of data, the correlation can be positive,
  negative, or zero. For example, the weight of a higher person is usually
  larger, so the correlation between the weight and height of a person is
  positive. The sales of a product are usually lower when the price of the
  product is higher, so the correlation between the price of a product and the
  volume of the product sold is negative. If there is no relationship between the
  two groups of data, then it is considered zero correlation.

  Below are the possible cases of linear correlation:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If every single point in the scatter plot is on the line of best fit, then it's
          a perfect positive correlation. If the slope of the line of best fit is
          positive, then it's a positive correlation. If the slope of the line of best
          fit is negative, then it's a negative correlation.

    \item If the points in the scatter plot are scattered around the line of best fit
          with non-zero slope, then the closer the points are to the line of best fit,
          the stronger the correlation is.

    \item If the points in the scatter plot are scattered evenly around the whole plot
          with no obvious pattern, then there is no correlation between the two
          variables, aka zero correlation.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{Correlation Coefficient}

  Telling the correlation between two variables by looking at the scatter plot is
  not a very accurate way. To accurately measure the correlation between two sets
  of data, we need to use a coefficient that can distinguish the strength of the
  correlation.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[->] (0, 0) -- (5, 0);
      \draw[->] (0, 0) -- (0, 5);

      \draw[dashed] (0.0, 2.2) -- (5.0, 2.2);

      \fill (2.0, 0.5) circle (0.06);
      \fill (2.1, 3.0) circle (0.06);
      \fill (3.6, 2.0) circle (0.06);
      \fill (3.6, 3.0) circle (0.06);
      \fill (3.8, 1.0) circle (0.06);
      \fill (4.5, 3.6) circle (0.06);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  Let the mean value of two sets of data be $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2,
    \dots, y_n$ be $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ respectively. Draw two lines $x =
    \bar{x}$ and $y = \bar{y}$ on the scatter plot of the two sets of data,
  splitting the plot into four quadrants, as shown in the figure above. Now the
  origin of the plot is at $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$. If a point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in
  the first or the third quadrant, then $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ is
  positive. As discussed in the previous section, if the correlation is positive,
  the points are scattering around the line of best fit with positive slope.
  Therefore, the points are more likely to be in the first or the third quadrant.
  That means, there are more positive value of $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$
  than negative value, therefore the value of $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i -
      \bar{y})}$ is positive. The higher the correlation is, the more points are in
  the first or the third quadrant, the higher the positive value of $\sum{(x_i -
      \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$ is.

  On the other hand, if a point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the second or the fourth
  quadrant, then $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ is negative, which means there
  are more negative value of $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ than positive
  value, therefore the value of $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$ is
  negative. Similarly, he higher the correlation is, the lower the negative value
  of $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$ is.

  Hence, the value and the sign of $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$ can be
  used to measure the correlation between two sets of data. The value of
  $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$ will be affected by the measurement unit
  of the data. To make the value of $\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}$
  independent of the measurement unit, we define the correlation coefficient of
  two sets of data $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ as:

  \begin{cequation}
    r = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}
  \end{cequation}

  The value of $r$ is always between $-1$ and $1$. If $r = 0$, then there is no
  correlation between the two sets of data. If $r > 0$, then the correlation is
  positive. If $r < 0$, then the correlation is negative. The absolute value of
  $r$ is the strength of the correlation, and is generally divided as follows:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $|r| = 1$: perfect correlation
    \item $0 < |r| < 0.3$: weak correlation
    \item $0.3 \leq |r| < 0.7$: moderate correlation
    \item $0.7 \leq |r| \leq 1$: strong correlation
  \end{enumerate}

  Dividing both the denominator and the numerator of the formula of $r$ by the
  number of data points $n$, then the numerator is the mean value of $(x_i -
    \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$, and the denominator is the product of the standard
  deviation of $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$. Similar to the
  standard deviation, there is an easier way to calculate the correlation
  coefficient:

  \begin{cequation}
    r = \frac{\frac{\sum{x_iy_i}}{n} - \bar{x}\bar{y}}{\sqrt{(\frac{\sum{x_i^2}}{n} - \bar{x}^2)(\frac{\sum{y_i^2}}{n} - \bar{y}^2)}}
  \end{cequation}

  \section{Statistical Index}

  \subsection*{Index}

  In statistics, an index is a number that measures the changes in a figure from
  one point in time to another. There is a wide range of applications of an
  index, such as the price index which represents the changes in prices, the
  production index which represents the changes in production, and the wage index
  which represents the changes in salaries and wages. There are also other
  indices such as the living index, foreign exchange index, population index,
  stock market index, etc.

  The index is a kind of relative number. The standard period that is used for
  comparison when calculating the index is called the base period. As the case
  may be, the base period can be a year or a month. The index of the base period
  is usually a number that is easier to be remembered and compared, such as 100,
  500, or 1000, and the chosen number must be able to represent the changes in
  the figure. We will use 100 as our base period index. The period that is used
  for comparison to the base period is called the current period. Let $Q_0$ be
  the base period index and $Q_1$ be the current period index. The index of the
  current period is calculated by the following formula:

  \begin{cequation}
    I = \frac{Q_1}{Q_0} \times 100
  \end{cequation}

  \noindent where 100 is the base period index.

  \subsection*{Price Relative}

  The price relative is a simple index that compares the prices of products in
  different periods. Let $P_0$ be the price of a product in the base period and
  $P_1$ be the price of the same product in the current period. The price
  relative of the current period is calculated by the following formula:

  \begin{cequation}
    I = \frac{P_1}{P_0} \times 100
  \end{cequation}

  \subsection{Practice 11}

  The table below shows the net profits (in million) of a company from 2010 to
  2014. Use the year 2010 as the base period and calculate the index of the net
  profit of the company in each year.

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Year       & 2010 & 2011 & 2012  & 2013  & 2014 \\
      \hline
      Net Profit & 700  & 621  & 584.1 & 720.5 & 800  \\

          \end{center}
          Find the value of $x$, $y$, and $z$.

  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{Composite Index}

  The composite index is the mean value of indices of different figures. Since
  the importance of each figure might be different, the weight of each index is
  used to represent the importance of each figure, and the acquired weighted mean
  is called the composite index.

  Let the simple index of $n$ figures of the same base period and the same
  current period be $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, and their respective weights be
  $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$. The composite index is calculated by the following
  formula:

  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{false}
  \makeatother
  \begin{flalign*}
    \bar{I} & = \frac{w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \cdots + w_n} \\
            & = \frac{\sum{w_ix_i}}{\sum{w_i}}
  \end{flalign*}
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{true}
  \makeatother

  If the study object is some product, where $x_i$ is the price relative to the
  $i^{th}$ product, then its weighted mean is called the price index. If the
  study object is the daily living expenses, then its weighted mean is called the
  living consumption index.

  \chapter{Permutations and Combinations}

  Permutations and combinations are the foundation of probability and statistics.
  In our daily life, we often need to calculate the number of ways of completing
  a task. These calculations are based on two basic principles: addition
  principle and multiplication principle.

  \section{Addition and Multiplication Principles}

  \begin{theorem}{Addition Principle}

    If there are $n$ methods of doing a task, the first method can be done in $m_1$
    ways, the second method can be done in $m_2$ ways, $\cdots$, the $n$th methods
    can be done in $m_n$ ways, and they are mutually exclusive, which means he task
    can be done in whatever way using whatever method, then the total number of
    ways of doing the task is
    \begin{cequation}
      m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_n
    \end{cequation}
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{theorem}{Multiplication Principle}

    If there are $n$ steps in doing a task, the first step can be done in $m_1$
    ways, the second step can be done in $m_2$ ways, $\cdots$, the $n$th steps can
    be done in $m_n$ ways, then the total number of ways of doing the task is
    \begin{cequation}
      m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_n
    \end{cequation}
  \end{theorem}

  \end{enumerate}

  \section{Permutations and Permutation Formula}

  \subsection*{Practice 2}

  How many ways are there to arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 into a two digit
  number with no repeated digits? \sol{}

  First step: choose one of the 4 numbers as the first digit, there are 4 ways to
  do so.

  Second step: choose one of the remaining 3 numbers as the second digit, there
  are 3 ways to do so.

  According to the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to arrange
  the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 into a two digit number with no repeated digits is $4
    \times 3 = 12$. \\\\ If there are $n$ elements, we want to pick $r$ elements
  from them and arrange them in a sequence, how many ways are there to do so?
  This question can be treated as there are $r$ empty boxes, which means this
  requires $r$ steps to complete.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,0.5) -- (5,0.5) -- (5,0) -- (0,0);
      \draw (1, 0) -- (1, 0.5);
      \draw (2, 0) -- (2, 0.5);
      \draw (3, 0) -- (3, 0.5);
      \draw (4, 0) -- (4, 0.5);
      \node at (0.5, 0.25) {$1^{st}$};
      \node at (1.5, 0.25) {$2^{nd}$};
      \node at (2.5, 0.25) {$3^{rd}$};
      \node at (3.5, 0.25) {$...$};
      \node at (4.5, 0.25) {$r^{th}$};
      \draw [->] (0.5, -0.5) -- (0.5, -0.1);
      \draw [->] (1.5, -1.0) -- (1.5, -0.1);
      \draw [->] (2.5, -0.5) -- (2.5, -0.1);
      \draw [->] (4.5, -0.5) -- (4.5, -0.1);
      \node at (0.5, -0.8) {\footnotesize{$n$ ways}};
      \node at (1.5, -1.3) {\footnotesize{$n-1$ ways}};
      \node at (2.5, -0.8) {\footnotesize{$n-2$ ways}};
      \node at (4.5, -0.8) {\footnotesize{$n-(r-1)$ ways}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  First step: CHhoose one element from $n$ elements and put it in the first box,
  then there are $n$ ways to do so.

  Second step: Choose one element from $n-1$ elements and put it in the second
  box, then there are $n-1$ ways to do so.

  Third step: Choose one element from $n-2$ elements and put it in the third box,
  then there are $n-2$ ways to do so.

  So on and so forth, when $r-1$ boxes are filled, the last box $r$ can only be
  filled with one of the remaining $n-(r-1)$ elements, so there are $n-(r-1)$
  ways to do so. According to the multiplication principle, the total number of
  ways to fill in $r$ boxes is
  \begin{cequation}
    n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)
  \end{cequation}
  Threrefore, there are $n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)$ ways to arrange $r$ elements, and this denoted as $\perm[n]{r}$, $\permtwo[n]{r}$, or $P^n_r$.
  \begin{cequation}
    \permtwo[n]{r} = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)
  \end{cequation}
  Where $r \leq n$, $n \in N$, $r = 0, 1, 2, \cdots, n$. This formula is called
  the permutation formula.

  When $r = n$, aka a full permutation, the formula becomes
  \begin{cequation}
    \permtwo[n]{n} = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
  \end{cequation}
  Therefore, the permutation of all $n$ elements is equal to the products of natural numbers from 1 to $n$. This is called the factorial of $n$, denoted as $n!$.
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{false}
  \makeatother
  \begin{flalign*}
    n! & = \permtwo[n]{n}                       \\
       & = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
  \end{flalign*}
  \makeatletter
  \setbool{@fleqn}{true}
  \makeatother

  Using factorial, the permutation formula can be transform into the following:
  \begin{flalign*}
    \permtwo[n]{r} & = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)                                                                      \\
                   & = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)(n-r) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(n-r) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} \\
                   & = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
  \end{flalign*}

  Hence, the permutation formula can be written as
  \begin{cequation}
    \permtwo[n]{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
  \end{cequation}

  Note: $0!$ is defined as 1 to make the formula work when $n = r$.

    \item From the 6 numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how many 4 digits numbers can be formed

  \section{Circular Permutations}

  In the permutation we have discussed in the previous section, all the elements
  are arranged in a row. This kind of permutation is called \textit{linear
    permutation}. Its identity is that it has a beginning and an end. The
  permutations we are going to discuss in this section are arranged on a closed
  curve line. This kind of permutation is called \textit{circular permutation}.
  The identity of circular permutation is that it has no beginning and no end.

  For this, we will use an example to explain the concept of circular
  permutation.

  Four people are to be seated in a circle. How many ways can they be seated?
  \sol{}

  Let these four people be $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ respectively.

  If these people are arranged in a row, there are $4!$ ways to arrange them.

  Let's take a look at the arrangements below:
  \begin{center}
    $A \quad B \quad C \quad D$

    $B \quad C \quad D \quad A$

    $C \quad D \quad A \quad B$

    $D \quad A \quad B \quad C$
  \end{center}
  You'll notice that the arrangements above are all the same if being arranged on
  a circle, and the only difference is the position of the first person.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0, 0) circle (1cm);
      \node at (1, 0) [fill=white] {$C$};
      \node at (0, 1) [fill=white] {$B$};
      \node at (-1, 0) [fill=white] {$A$};
      \node at (0, -1) [fill=white] {$D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0, 0) circle (1cm);
      \node at (1, 0) [fill=white] {$D$};
      \node at (0, 1) [fill=white] {$C$};
      \node at (-1, 0) [fill=white] {$B$};
      \node at (0, -1) [fill=white] {$A$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0, 0) circle (1cm);
      \node at (1, 0) [fill=white] {$A$};
      \node at (0, 1) [fill=white] {$D$};
      \node at (-1, 0) [fill=white] {$C$};
      \node at (0, -1) [fill=white] {$B$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0, 0) circle (1cm);
      \node at (1, 0) [fill=white] {$B$};
      \node at (0, 1) [fill=white] {$A$};
      \node at (-1, 0) [fill=white] {$D$};
      \node at (0, -1) [fill=white] {$C$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  From the above example, each circular permutation is correspended to 4 linear
  permutations. Given that the permutation of 4 people arranging in a row has
  $4!$ ways, so there are $\frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6$ ways to arrange these four
  people in a circle.

  If we generalize the above example, we can get the following formula:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The formula of circular permutation of $n$ elements:
          \begin{cequation}
            \frac{\permtwo[n]{n}}{n} = \frac{n!}{n} = (n - 1)!
          \end{cequation}
    \item The formula of circular permutation of $r$ elements from $n$ elements ($r \leq
            n$):
          \begin{cequation}
            \frac{\permtwo[n]{r}}{r} = \frac{n!}{r(n - r)!}
          \end{cequation}
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Choose 5 people from 6 males and 5 females to be seated in a circle. How many
          ways can they be seated?

    \item 6 males and 4 females are to be seated around a circular table. If females can't seat beside each other, how many ways can they be seated?
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Exercise 19.3}

    \item 6 people are to be formed into a circle. If two people must seat together, how many ways can they be arranged?

    \item 4 males and 3 females are to be seated around a circular table. If none of the females can seat together, how many ways can they be seated?

    \item 4 pairs of couples and one child are to be seated around a circular table. If the couples must sit together, how many ways can they be seated?

    \item A family of 7 people are sitting together around a circular table for a dinner.
          If the grandfather, grandmother, father and mother must sit together, of which
          the grandfather and the grandmother, the father and the mother must sit
          together, how many ways can they be seated?

    \item If a linear permutation of $n$ people is 6 times of a circular permutation of
          $n$ people, find these two permutations.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{Full Permutations of Inexactly Distinct Elements}

  In all the previous questions of permutations, the given elements are all
  distinct. However, in some cases, there are some elements that are the same,
  this kind of permutation are considered as \emph{permutations with repetition}.
  Let's discusse the folowing example:

  For a full permutation of three elements $a$, $a$, and $b$, how many ways can
  they be arranged?

  Let's treat the identical elemnents $a$ as two different elements $a_1$ and
  $a_2$, there will be 3! ways to arrange these three different element $a_1$,
  $a_2$, and $b$, as listed below:

  \begin{center}
    $a_1 \quad a_2 \quad b \qquad a_2 \quad a_1 \quad b$

    $a_1 \quad b \quad a_2 \qquad a_2 \quad b \quad a_1$

    $b \quad a_1 \quad a_2 \qquad b \quad a_2 \quad a_1$
  \end{center}

  In the three rows above, for each row, the position of $b$ is fixed, $a_1$ and
  $a_2$ has $2! = 2$ ways to be arranged.

  If we change $a_1$ and $a_2$ above back to $a$, then the two different
  arrangements of $a_1$ and $a_2$ will be counted as one arrangement of $a$.
  Hence, there are only $\frac{3!}{2!} = 3$ ways for full permutation of three
  elements $a$, $a$, and $b$.

  Generalize the above example, given $n$ elements, where there are $n_1$
  elements $a_1$, $n_2$ elements $a_2$, $\cdots$, $n_k$ elements $a_k$, where
  $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k = n$, then the number of full permutations of these
  $n$ elements is:
  \begin{cequation}
    \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}
  \end{cequation}

  \subsection{Practice 7}

  If the elements can be chosen more than once, arranging $r$ elements from $n$
  elements is called \emph{permutation with repetition} of $r$ elements from $n$
  elements.

  there are $n$ ways to choose the first element, $n$ ways to choose the second
  element, $\cdots$, $n$ ways to choose the $r$th element. According to the
  multiplication rule, its permutations are:
  \begin{cequation}

          the first digit, 10 ways to choose the rest of the digits. Hence, there are $8

          When there are only 7 digits, there are 8 ways to choose the first digit (2 -

          When there are only 7 digits, there are 8 ways to choose the first digit (2 -

            \times 10^6$ phone numbers. When there are 8 digits, there are 8 ways to choose
          the first digit, 10 ways to choose the rest of the digits. Hence, there are $8

          new phone numbers.

  \section{Combinations and Combination Formula}

  Grouping $r$ elements from $n$ elements ($r \leq n$) without considering the
  order of the elements is called \emph{combination} of $r$ elements from $n$
  elements. The number of combinations of $r$ elements from $n$ elements is
  denoted by $\combtwo[n]{r}$, $\comb[n]{r}$, or $\binom{n}{r}$.

  Take for example: taking two elements from three distinct element $a$, $b$, $c$
  to form a group. Below are the combinations of any two elements from $a$, $b$,
  $c$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Permutations & $ab$                      & $ba$                      & $ac$                      & $ca$ & $bc$ & $cb$ \\
      \hline
      Combinations & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$ab$} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$ac$} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$bc$}                      \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  It can be considered as two steps:

  First, combine any two elements from the three distinct elements to form a
  group. There are $\comb[3]{2}$ possible combinations.

  Second, make full permutations for each combination. There are $2!$ possible
  permutations for each combination.

  According to the multiplication rule,
  \begin{flalign*}
    \permtwo[3]{2}            & = \comb[3]{2} \times 2!     \\
    \therefore\ \ \comb[3]{2} & = \frac{\permtwo[3]{2}}{2!} \\
                              & = 3
  \end{flalign*}

  Generalizing the above example, there are two steps to find the combinations of
  $r$ elements from $n$ elements:

  First, combine any $r$ elements from the $n$ elements to form a group. There
  are $\comb[n]{r}$ possible combinations.

  Second, make full permutations for each combination. There are $r!$ possible
  permutations for each combination.

  According to the multiplication rule,
  \begin{flalign*}
    \permtwo[n]{r}            & = \comb[n]{r} \times r!             \\
    \therefore\ \ \comb[n]{r} & = \frac{\permtwo[n]{r}}{r!}         \\
                              & = \frac{n!}{(n - r)! r!},\ r \leq n
  \end{flalign*}

  According to the definition $\comb[n]{r} = \frac{n!}{(n - r)! r!}$,
  \begin{flalign*}
    \comb[n]{n-r} & = \frac{n!}{(n - (n - r))! (n - r)!} \\
                  & = \frac{n!}{r! (n - r)!}             \\
                  & = \comb[n]{r}
  \end{flalign*}

  That is,
  \begin{cequation}
    \comb[n]{r} = \comb[n]{n - r}
  \end{cequation}

  Note that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $r = n$, then $\comb[n]{n} = \frac{n!}{0! n!} = 1$.
    \item If $r = 0$, then $\comb[n]{0} = \frac{n!}{n! 0!} = 1$.
  \end{enumerate}

                    \comb[n]{r} & = \comb[n]{n-r} \\
