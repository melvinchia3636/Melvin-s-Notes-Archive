# unified-latex-util-match

## What is this?

Functions to match different `Ast.Node` types in a `unified-latex` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## When should I use this?

If you need a type-guard to ensure a node is of a certain type; for example, during a call to `unified-latex-until-visit`.

## Install

```bash
npm install @unified-latex/unified-latex-util-match
```
