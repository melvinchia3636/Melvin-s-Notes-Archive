 * Clean up any whitespace issues in an enumerate environment. In particular,
 *      * Remove any leading or ending whitespace
 *      * Ensure there is a par between occurrences of `\item`
 *      * Ensure there is whitespace after each occurrence of `\item` provided there is content there
 * `itemName` can be used to set what the "item" macro is called.
 *
 * This function attaches content following a `\item` to the `\item` macro with
 * `openMark` and `closeMark` set to empty. This allows hanging-indents to be rendered.
