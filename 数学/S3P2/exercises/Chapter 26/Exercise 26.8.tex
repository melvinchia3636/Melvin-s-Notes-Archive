\subsection{Exercise 26.8}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The side length of a cube increased from 4cm to $4.001$cm, how much does its
          area increase approximately?
    \item The radius of a circle increases from 3cm to $3.01$cm, find the approximate
          increment of its area.
    \item The radius of a sphere decrease from 3cm to $2.98$cm, find the approximate
          decrement of its volume,
    \item Let $y = 3x^5$. If $x$ is decreased by $0.2\%$, how many percent does $y$
          decrease approximately?
    \item If the side length of a cube increases ny $1\%$, how many percent does its
          volume increase approximately?
    \item Let the surface area of a solid right cylinder with a height of 16cm and a
          radius of $r$cm be $A$.
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Prove that $\dfrac{dA}{dr} = 4\pi(r+8)$.
              \item If the height of the right cylinder remains the same, using the result obtained
                    from (a), find, when the radius of the right cylinder increases from 4cm to
                    $4.02$cm, the approximate increment of its surface area.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item If $y = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$, find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$. Hence, find the
          approximate value of $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{99.4}}$. (Correct your answer to 4
          decimal paces)
    \item If $y = x^{\frac{1}{4}}$, find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$. Hence, find the approximate
          value of $16.05^{\frac{1}{4}}$. (Correct your answer to 4 decimal places)
