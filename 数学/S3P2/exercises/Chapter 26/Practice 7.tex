\subsection{Practice 7}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A drop of ink gradually spread after being dropped onto a piece of paper. At
          $t$ seconds, its area is $A = \left(3t^2 + \dfrac{1}{5}t + 2\right)$mm$^2$.
          Find the rate of change of the ink spread at $t = 2$ second.
    \item The radius of a sphere increases at a rate of $3$cm/s. When the radius is
          $5$cm, find the rate of change of the surface area of the sphere.
\end{enumerate}
