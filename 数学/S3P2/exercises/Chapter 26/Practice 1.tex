\subsection{Practice 1}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the equations of tangent and normal to the curve $y = x^3$ where $x = 2$.
    \item Given that the gradient of tangent to the curve $y = x^2 - 2x + 3$ at point $Q$
          is $4$, find the coordinates of the point $Q$.
    \item Find the equations of the tangent and normal to the curve $x^3 - 2xy + y^2 = 1$
          at point $(1, 2)$.
\end{enumerate}
