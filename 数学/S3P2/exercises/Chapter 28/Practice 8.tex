\subsection{Practice 8}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that the line $x + y = a$ splits the circle $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$ into two
          parts, find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by rotating the
          smaller part of the circle about the $x$-axis.
    \item Given that a region is bounded by the curve $y^2 = 8 - x$ and $y^2 = x - 4$.
          Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by rotating this region about
          the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis respectively.
\end{enumerate}
