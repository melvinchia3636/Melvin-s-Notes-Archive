\section{Tangent and Normal Lines}

In the previous chapter, we have learnt that the gradient of the tangent to the
curve $y=f(x)$ at point $P\big(x_0, f(x_0)\big)$ is
\begin{flalign*}
    m & = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\dfrac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x} & \\
      & = f'(x_0)
\end{flalign*}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    Hence, in order to find the tangent to the curve $y = f(x)$ at $x = x_0$, we just have to find the derivative value $f'(x_0)$ of the curve $y = f(x)$ at $x = x_0$, then the equation of the tangent line can be acquired through the point gradient formula of linear equations.

    As shown in the right figure, the line that passes through point $P$ and
    perpendicular to the tangent line $PT$ is known as the normal line to the curve
    $y = f(x)$. If two straight lines are perpendicular, the product of their
    gradients is $-1$. Since the gradient of the curve $y = f(x)$ at point $x =
        x_0$ is $f'(x_0)$, therefore when $f'(x_0) \neq 0$, the gradient of normal at
    point $x = x_0$ is $-\dfrac{1}{f'(x_0)}$.

\section{Increasing and Decreasing Functions}

\subsection*{Monotonic Functions}

For a function $f(x)$ being defined in the interval $D$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $D$, when $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x)$ is an
          increasing function in the interval $D$, as shown in the figure below.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-2.png}
          \end{center}
    \item For any two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $D$, when $x_1 > x_2$, $f(x)$ is a
          decreasing function in the interval $D$, as shown in the figure below.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-3.png}
          \end{center}
\end{enumerate}
If $f(x)$ is an increasing function or a decreasing function in the interval $D$, we call $f(x)$ a monotonic function in the interval $D$.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-4.png}
\end{center}
The curve shown in the diagram above is the graph of the function $f(x)$ in the
interval $[-5, 5]$. From the graph, we can see that the function $f(x)$ is a
decreasing function in the intervals $[-5, 2]$ and $[1, 3]$, and an increasing
function in the interval $[-2, 1]$ and $[3, 5]$.

\subsection*{How to Judge the Increase or Decrease of Functions}

As shown in the diagram below, when the function $f(x)$ is an increasing
function in the interval $[a, b]$, the gradient of the tangent to the curve at
any point in the interval $(a, b)$ is positive, i.e. $f'(x) > 0$; when the
function $f(x)$ is a decreasing function in the interval $[b, c]$, the gradient
of the tangent to the curve at any point in the interval $(b, c)$ is negative,
i.e. $f'(x) < 0$.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-5.png}
\end{center}
Therefore, we can judge whether a function is an increasing function or a decreasing function in an interval by the sign of the derivative value of the function in the interval:
\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][3.8cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.6cm} \hspace{0.4cm}Let $f(x)$ be a continuous
            function defined in the interval $[a, b]$, and can be differentiated in

            \hspace{0.4cm}the interval $(a, b)$.

            \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.76cm]
                \item In the interval $(a, b)$, if $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is an increasing function
                      in the interval $[a, b]$.
                \item In the interval $(a, b)$, if $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is a decreasing function
                      in the interval $[a, b]$.
            \end{itemize} }}

\section{Relative Maximum and Minimum Values of Functions}

As shown in the diagram below, the function value $f(a)$ at the point where
$x=a$ is the maximum compared to its nearby points, we call $f(a)$ the relative
maximum value; the function value $f(b)$ at the point where $x=b$ is the
minimum compared to its nearby points, we call $f(b)$ the relative minimum
value.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-6.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][5cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.6cm} \hspace{0.4cm}Let $f(x)$ be a defined
            function near point $x=a$,
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \parbox[t]{12.5cm}{If the function value $f(a)$ is the maximum compared to its
                          nearby points, we say that $f(x)$ has a relative maximum value $f(a)$ at point
                          $x=a$, and the point $(a, f(a))$ is the relative maximum point of the
                          function;}
                \item \parbox[t]{12.5cm}{If the function value $f(a)$ is the minimum compared to its
                          nearby points, we say that $f(x)$ has a relative minimum value $f(a)$ at point
                          $x=a$, and the point $(a, f(a))$ is the relative minimum point of the
                          function.}
            \end{itemize}
        }}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.9em}

Relative maximum and minimum values are collectively known as the extreme
values, and the points where the extreme values occur are collectively known as
the extreme points.

From the diagram above, we can also see that the gradients of the tangent to
the curve at the extreme points are zero. Hence, the following theorem can be
obtained:
\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][1.6cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.4cm} \centering \parbox{13cm}{If the function $f(x)$ is differentiable at point $x=a$, and $f(x)$
                has a relative maximum or minimum value at point $x=a$, then $f'(a)=0$.} }}
\end{center}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    The points that satisfy $f'(x)=0$ are called the stationary points of the
    function.

    If the function can be differentiated at point $x=a$, then the extreme point
    must be a stationary point. However, the stationary point is not necessarily an
    extreme point. For example, the derivative of the function $f(x)=x^3$ is
    $f'(x)=3x^2$, and $f'(0)=0$, i.e. $O(0, 0)$ is a stationary point of the
    function $f(x)=x^3$, but it is not an extreme point of the function, as shown
    in the right diagram. \vfill{}\null{}

\subsection*{How to Find the Extreme Values of Functions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{First Derivative Test}

          The curve has a positive gradient of tangent to the left of the relative
          maximum point, and a negative gradient of tangent to the right; the curve has a
          negative gradient of tangent to the left of the relative minimum point, and a
          positive gradient of tangent to the right. Hence, the following theorem is
          obtained:
          \begin{center}

                          \end{itemize} }
                  }}
          \end{center}
          \vspace{0.9em}

    \item \textbf{Second Derivative Test}
          \begin{center}
              \framebox{
                  \parbox[t][2.5cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.4cm} \centering \parbox{13cm}{Let $f(x)$ be a function that is second derivable near point $x=a$,

                              \item \parbox[t]{12.5cm}{If $f''(a) < 0$, then $f(a)$ is a relative maximum value;}

                  }}
          \end{center}

          Note that the second derivative test is invalid when $f''(a) = 0$, and the
          first derivative test should be used instead.

\section{Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values of Functions}

Shown in the diagram below is the graph of the curve of the function $f(x)$ in
the interval $[a, b]$. From the diagram, we know that $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_3)$ are
the relative minimum value, while $f(x_2)$ is the relative maximum value. In
solving practical problems, we are often concerned with the maximum and minimum
values of the function in the entire domain. In the diagram below, the absolute
maximum value of the function $f(x)$ is $f(b)$, and the absolute minimum value
is $f(x_3)$.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-8.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][1.6cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.4cm} \centering \parbox{13.5cm}{If the function $f(x)$ is continuous in the close interval $[a,
                            b]$, then the function $f(x)$ must have the absolute maximum value and the
                absolute minimum value in the interval $[a, b]$.} }}
\end{center}

The function $f(x)$ that is continuous in the open interval $(a, b)$ may not
have the absolute maximum value and the absolute minimum value. For example,
the function $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$ is continuous in the interval $(0, \infty)$,
but it does not have the absolute maximum value and the absolute minimum value.
Also in the diagram above, if the domain is defined as the open interval $(a,
    b)$, then the function $f(x)$ only has the relative minimum value but not the
absolute minimum value.

From the diagram above, if the function is continuous in the interval $[a, b]$,
we just have to make comparison between all the extreme points and vertices of
the function to find the absolute maximum value and the absolute minimum value
of the function.

\section{The Convexity and the Point of Inflection of Functions}

For a curve $y = f(x)$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a given interval, if the tangent line of the curve is always above the
          curve, then the curve convex up in the interval, as shown in the diagram below.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-12.png}
          \end{center}
    \item In a given interval, if the tangent line of the curve is always below the
          curve, then the curve is convex down in the interval, as shown in the diagram
          below.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-13.png}
          \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

If two sides of a point on a curve of a function $y = f(x)$ changes their
concavity, then the demarcation point is called the point of inflection of the
curve.

Now we discuss the way to determine the convexity and the point of inflection
of a function. In the diagram below, the left side of the point $x = x_0$
convex down, and the right side convex up.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{assets/26-14.png}
\end{center}
In the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$ that convex up, when the tangents to the curve cut the curve at $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively from left to right, the gradients of the tangent lines $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ are decreasing, i.e. the gradient of the tangent $f'(x)$ is decreasing.

In the interval $(x_0, \infty)$ that convex down, when the tangents to the
curve cut the curve at $P_4$, $P_5$, and $P_6$ respectively from left to right,
the gradients of the tangent lines $m_4$, $m_5$, and $m_6$ are increasing, i.e.
the gradient of the tangent $f'(x)$ is increasing.

We have the following theorem:
\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][2.7cm]{14cm}{ \addvspace{0.4cm} \hspace{0.4cm}Let function $f(x)$ has
            second derivative $f''(x)$.
            \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.8cm]
                \item \parbox[t]{12.5cm}{If $f''(x) > 0$ in a given interval, then the curve is convex
                          up;}
                \item \parbox[t]{12.5cm}{If $f''(x) < 0$ in a given interval, then the curve is convex
                          down.}
            \end{itemize} }}
\end{center}

\section{Curve Sketching}

Having learnt the derivatives, we can use the concepts of the increasing and
decreasing of a function, the convexity and the point of inflection of a
function to sketch the curve of a function in a rather accurate way. Listed
below are the steps to sketch the curve of a function:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the point of intersections of the curve with the axes;
    \item Solve the equation $f'(x) = 0$, and determine the intervals where the function
          is increasing or decreasing and the extreme values;
    \item Solve the equation $f''(x) = 0$, and determine the intervals where the curve is
          convex up or convex down and the points of inflection;
    \item Draw the curve according to the above information.
\end{enumerate}
The steps above are not necessarily to be followed in the order listed, and can be adjusted according to the actual situation.

\section{Rate of Change and Related Rate of Change}

The derivative of the function $y = f(x)$ at the point $x = x_0$ is known as
the rate of change of the dependent value $y$ with respect to the independent
value $x$ at the point $x = x_0$. For example, $\dfrac{d y}{d x} = 3$ means
that when $x$ increases by $1$ unit, $y$ increases by $3$ units, i.e. $y$ and
$x$ are both changing, and they are changing in the ratio of $3:1$.

The same can be said that the derivative of the area function $A = A(t)$ at the
time $t = t_0$ is the rate of change of the area with respect to the time at
the time $t = t_0$. When the rate of change of the area at $t = t_0$ is
$\dfrac{d A}{d t} = 4$cm$^2$/s, it means that the area is increasing in the
rate of 4 square centimetres per second; while $\dfrac{d A}{d t} = -4$cm$^2$/s
means that the area is decreasing in the rate of 4 square centimetres per
second.

If multiple variables are correlated by a specific relationship, these
variables are all changing with respect to time, then there must be some kind
of bonds between their respective rate of changes. This relationship between
the rate of changes is called the related rate of change. If $y = f(x)$ is the
function of $x$, and $x$ changes with respect to $t$, then since $y$ is
changing with respect to $x$, $y$ is also changing with respect to $t$. In
other words, $y$ is also a function of the time $t$. HEnce, from the chain
rule, we can obtain the following relationship:
\begin{cequation}
    \dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{dy}{dx} \cdot \dfrac{dx}{dt}
\end{cequation}
i.e. the rate of change of $y$ is correlated to the rate of change of $x$.

\input{exercises/Chapter 26/Practice 7.tex}
\input{exercises/Chapter 26/Exercise 26.7.tex}

\section{Approximate Calculation}

In the previous chapter, we have learnt that the derivative of the function $y
    = f(x)$ is
\begin{cequation}
    \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\dfrac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
\end{cequation}
From the definition of limit, we know that when $\Delta x$ is small enough,
\begin{cequation}
    \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \approx \dfrac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
\end{cequation}
Hence,
\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][1.2cm]{9cm}{ \addvspace{0.25cm} \centering $\Delta y \approx
                \dfrac{dy}{dx}\Delta x$ }}
\end{center}
or $f(x + \Delta x) - f(x) \approx f'(x)\Delta x$, i.e.
\begin{center}
    \framebox{
        \parbox[t][1.2cm]{9cm}{ \addvspace{0.45cm} \centering $f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x)
                + f'(x)\Delta x$ }}
\end{center}

The expression above is a simple formula for approximate calculation that can
be used to find the approximate value of a function.
