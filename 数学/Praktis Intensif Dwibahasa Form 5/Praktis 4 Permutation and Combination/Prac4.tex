                  participants are divided equally into 5 groups. ALl the participants in each
                  group are instructed to take their seats in their respective classrooms. Before

                  other. Find
                  \begin{enumerate}
                        \item the number of handshakes made between the participants in Group A,
                        \item the number of handshakes made if Afiq, Ben and Cathy do not shake hands.
