# Why Exams Are Useless

Exam" is a four-letter dirty word no student wants to hear. Ever since its inception, it has been associated with stress and competition. Many students dread the daily trip to school all because of it. It's also frightening to see the school curiculum revolving around exam preparation and nothing more. In my opinion, examinations themselves are not the problem as they also serve as a method for students to gauge their learning ability. What renders exams useless is the way society views exams. To most people grades are all there in to an exam failure is not an option. As a result, many take an exam for the sake of taking it or just to attain a grade to show off to everyone. As a result, exams become "do-or-die" as students feel stressed due to the fear of failure and humilation. This discuss how and why exams have becomoe useless in the modern world.

### Reason #1: Unnecessary Stress

Because of the way society views examinations, students are pressured to excel and succeed. It's now all about the 'A+' on the report card and nothing more. In the mind of a student, his/her success is wholly dependent on his/her eduational qualifications. As a result, many students go to extreme measures just to obtain a desired grade. This includes forgoing sleep, long study hours and endless tuituion classes. Instead of allowing students to enhance their learning, examinations now do more damage to their mental and physical wellbeing. Only if society learns not to treat failure as the end can learning be possible. Schools should also not focus solely on exam preparation and cut down on the content tested at one time.



### Reason #2: The Joy of Learning is Taken Away

Students are now given piles and piles of homework, forced to study many subjects and take exams they clearly dread. Learning now becomes conficed to mere memory, answering techniques and essay writing skills. Instead of cultivating students who are attuned to the world and are enthusiastic to learn, schools produces studetns who have been trained to become answering machines in every respect - "If A, then B; if question asks X, I give Y." For the joy of learning to be present in the classroom and beyond, society needs to place less emphasis on the importance of academic qualifications and a person's learning abilities. Now, students memorize heaps of knowledge just to regurgitate it on the exam paper. In fact, more students forget all the knowledge they have learnt right after an exam and do not follow up on it, unless a future exam requires it. Evidently, most students of the modern world do not possess curiosity or the desire for learning.



### Reason #3: Exams Become a Race to the Top

Instead of learning for themselves, students now, in a sense, learn for others. Due to the fact that society places so much emphasis on academic success, exams become a platform to show off their intellectual prowess. Students work themselves to the bone just to beat each other and become the best among their peers. Learning now becomes all about winning. Because of this, those at the top start to become arrogant while those who are struggling at the bottom are looked down on. The truth is, life is not all about winning or losing. It is better to be at the bottom and be contented than be at the 

top and be unhappy. All men strive for happiness, do they not? There is no point in learning if it brings no happiness. Rather than focusing on having their students achieve academic excellence, schools should focus on cultivating the joy of learning in students. It is better to have average but enthusiastic and happy students rather than disgruntled and insecure students who have 'A+'s everywhere.
