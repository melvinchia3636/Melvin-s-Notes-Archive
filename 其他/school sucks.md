# Why School Sucks?

​		Teachers fail you if you do not do something their way. Some teachers make you copy the notes he/she gives word for word. ICT homework requires you to do something exactly as shown in the picture.

​		They take too much time out of your day. 7:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. (sometimes it goes to 4:45 p.m.), almost 9 hours of staying at school, you waste your life learning nonsense.

​		It causes depression. Of course it sucks when you get a bad grade, and that's the main reason for depression.

​		You have to get up early. I take the bus to school and have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, leaving no more than 6 hours of sleep time.

​		You are brainwashed. The school forces you to follow what they said. You are forced to believe everything the schools tell you and you can never questioned about it.

​		It teaches you things you will never need in life. We learn everything just in case we need it, but in reality, more than 90% of what we learn is useless for our future career and we only learn it for the exam.

​		You don't learn what is important, such as how to pay your taxes, how to cook, how to raise a child, etc. We can use the time we are learning history and geography to learn these useful skills that we will most likely need in our future.

​		You can not eat when you are hungry. During the entire 8 hours that you sit in the classroom, you have only a few short breaks.

​		You have to ask to use the toilet. Why? Is not it part of human rights to pee or poop whenever we want? Students' freedom to maintain their personal hygiene is severely curtailed.

​		It makes them feel powerless. School never taught us how to find a goal to work towards, so we feel life is meaningless. Schoolwork is usually useless and students often hate it. Most students become depressed and lose their goal in life when they perform poorly in school. Intense competition between students. Some of the students who are unable to learn feel powerless.

​		They are treated like a toddler. The teacher always keeps an eye on everything you do. You are punished if you do something you are not allowed to do. Many rules (even some really ridiculous ones) have been made so that students can be easily controlled.

​		You are not allowed to have your own opinion. Little consideration is given to your opinion by school authorities and teachers. You are strictly forbidden to say anything bad about your school or discuss anything that might destroy the name of the school.

​		You can never have a perfect day because a project is overdue. Your grades will still be deducted even if you turn in your work within 1 minute of the deadline. Most students have to sacrifice their personal time to slog through their homework just because they have to do it before the deadline.
