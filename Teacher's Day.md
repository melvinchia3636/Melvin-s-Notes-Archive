[My]() beloved mentor, Mr. Hew:

Today is not the teachers' day. But by the time you receive this letter, it will be. I have never written anything to a teacher on this day of honor, and you are the first one I am writing to. I could have just texted you all this, but that might have been a little disingenuous. The school board gave us a small, pathetic looking piece of colored paper today, and we are asked to at least write something to our teacher. Since I obviously know that the space on this piece of paper is nowhere near enough to express my appreciation, I simply use it to fold a paper crane.

Since the day I met you two years ago, I already knew that you aren't the conventional kind of teacher. You have the courage to criticize some really stupid things done by the school board. You have the courage to speak your mind. You have taught me that failing an exam isn't the end of the world, although I've hardly failed an exam in the past when it comes to scoring 60 points and above. They made me realize that I don't have to waste my time doing useless things, like listening to the teacher for hours or even days when he explains something that I could literally understand in less than 5 minutes by reading the textbook. Everything I mentioned above is just the tip of the iceberg. You have taught me a really important life lesson: BE YOURSELF. This is and will always be my motto for the rest of my life.

And another great, if not the best thing about you is that you always prepare additional exercises for the students. For me personally, exercises have always been the best way to reinforce what I've learned, even though most of the time the material on these practice sheets is as simple as child's play. Whenever you gave practice sheets to the class, or exclusively just for me, I'll just happily finish them and move on with my life. Unlike most other teachers who get mad at me when I do something else during class even though I've already done everything they've assigned or I've already understood the material they're explaining to me, you encourage me not to waste my time during your class.

If only I didn't have to spend 8 hours every day crammed into a tiny room with 50 students. If only I didn't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom, when that is one of the most basic human rights. If only I didn't have to wait 30 more minutes for others just to do their task after I've done the same task within 10 minutes. The current education system really needs some changes, if not a complete makeover. You may be wondering why I'm telling you all this? Because I think you're the only one I know who could understand me.

With that in mind, I can't thank you enough for teaching me many things, except English.

By the way, this letter is properly sealed, and I hope no one will look through it before it's forwarded to you, or we'll both be in big trouble.



Sincerely,

Melvin, a rebillious student.
