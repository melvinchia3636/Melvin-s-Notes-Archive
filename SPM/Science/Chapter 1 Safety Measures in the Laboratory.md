## 1.2 Disposal of Waste

- Substances that **can** be disposed into sinks
  - have low concentration 低浓度
  - non-hazardous
    - neutral substances 中性物质
    - weak acids 弱酸
    - weak alkalis 弱碱
- Substances that **cannot** be disposed into sinks (can polute the environment and are hazardous to living things)
  - solid waste
  - substances with pH value lower than 5 and more than 9
  - organic solvent compounds 有机溶剂
  - chemical substances (acid, grease 润滑油, oil, oil paint, hydrogen peroxide 过氧化氢)
  - toxic substances
  - heavy metals 重金属
  - organic waste substances 有机废物 (microbes 微生物, carcasses 尸体)
  - radioactive waste 放射性废料
  - volatile substances 挥发性物质
  - reactive substances 活性物质

### Managing Biological Waste Substances

Biological waste substances 生物废料 include disposed biological substances that can cause serious harm or biological hazards 生物性危害.

#### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

| Waste substance category           | Category A                                                   | Category B                                                   | Category C                                                   | Category D                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type of biological waste substance | Sharp equipment                                              | Non-sharp Equipment                                          | Carcasses, organs                                            | Liquid                                                       |
| Examples                           | - Syringe<br />- Needle<br />- Scalpel blade                 | - Gloves<br />- Tissue<br />- Culture medium                 | - Lab animals<br />- Experimental animals                    | - Blood<br />- Serum                                         |
| Biological waste management        | - Placed in special containers (sharps waste bins)<br />- Not autoclaved 高压灭菌<br />- Container is stored in a safe place before disposal | - Packaged and palced in biohazard plastic bags<br />- Autoclaved and placed into biohazard bins | - Wrapped in absorbent material (tissue paper), packaged well in a biohazard plastic bag and frozen before disposal | - Decontaminated by autoclave<br />- Disposed of directly into sewage system through the sink or toilet |

#### Flow of Disposing Biological Waste Substances

1. Carry out the separation of waste at the source correctly.
2. Waste substance category:
   1. Category A - Temporarily stored in a sare place
   2. Category B - Placed in a leak-proof autoclave bag and autoclaved (temparature 121°C, pressure 15psi, 20 minutes)
   3. Category C - Packaged carefully and temporarily stored in a freezer
3. Waste that has been decontaminated is placed into a biohazard bag.
4. Waste that has been packaged is labelled and placed in biohazard bins. Biohazard bins are temporarily stored in a safe, controlled condition and colled before centralised disposal is carried out.

### Steps to Handle Accidents in the Laboratory

Types of common accidents:

- Hand cut by glass splinter
- Hand splashed by concentrated acid or alkali
- Small fire
- Contact with residue 残渣 from the reaction of reactive metals
- Broken thermometer 溫度計
- Gas leak
- Electric shock

When carring out an experiment, your friend spills a type of chemical substance on the table.

1. Inform the teacher or the laboratory assistant.
2. Make the spillage area a restricted zone.
3. Stop teh spillage from spreading by using sand to form a boundary.
4. Scoop the chemical spillage.
5. Disposed of it safely.

A thermometer that is dropped and broken will cause mercury 水银 spillage. Mercury poisoning happens when someone touches it or it absorbs through the skin in certain quantities. Mercury can attack the nervous system, digestive tract, reproductive system and kidneys.

1. Inform the teacher or the laboratory assistant immediately.
2. Make the spillage area a restricted zone.
3. Sprinkle sulphur powder onto the spillage.
4. Call the Fire Department.

## 1.3 Fire Extinguishers

### Type of Fire Extinguishers

A fire extinguisher is a device that is used to control or extinguish fire.

| Type           | Color | Extinguish                                                   |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Water          | Red   | Flammable solids such as cloth, paper and wood.              |
| Foam           | Cream | Flammable solids such as paper and wood as well as types of liquid or gas that are flamable such as oil, paint and natural gas. |
| Carbon diovide | Black | Fire that involves electrical appliances, gas and vapour.    |
| Dry powder     | Blue  | All types of fires.                                          |
